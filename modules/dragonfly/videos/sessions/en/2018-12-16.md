With the emergence and development of Kubernetes,
it's becoming possible to run and operate large-scale containerized applications and services in enterprise environments.
How to securely and effectively manage the lots of container images produced in the enterprise organizations
and distribute them to the large-scale runtimes with less time and efforts when starting applications
or services on demand is still a challenge.
In this presentation, we'll introduce a joint solution from the open source trust cloud-native registry Harbor and
the open source intelligent P2P based file distribution system Dragonfly to address the above challenge.
The main contents include:

 1. Manage your container images in a secure and effective way.
 2. Distribute your container image in the P2P way by layers.
 3. Pre-release your container applications from the image registry.
 4. Let's see the fantastic demo.
