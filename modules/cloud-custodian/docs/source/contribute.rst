If you're interested in contributing to Cloud Custodian development, welcome! Please take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with the project and our expectations.

Developer install

Issues
------

We use `GitHub Issues <https://github.com/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian/issues>`_ to report and track work on the project.

Discussion is also available on `Gitter <https://gitter.im/cloud-custodian/cloud-custodian>`_ and a `Google Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cloud-custodian>`_.


Code of Conduct
---------------

This project adheres to the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)

By participating, you are expected to honor this code.


Contributor agreement
---------------------

As a CNCF Project, we've chosen to use the foundation's Contributor License Agreements
https://github.com/cncf/cla

to ensure that contributions are authorized and in good faith. We do this in preference to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
as a large portion of our contributor community don't have familiarity with it.

The contributor agreement signing  process is managed through the use of the Linux Foundation's EasyCLA opensource project
and is automatically verified on any pull requests.
