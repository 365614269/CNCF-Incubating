[Dapr Agents Quickstarts](https://github.com/dapr/dapr-agents/tree/main/quickstarts) demonstrate how to use Dapr Agents to build applications with LLM-powered autonomous agents and event-driven workflows. Each quickstart builds upon the previous one, introducing new concepts incrementally.

#### Before you begin

- [Set up your local Dapr environment]({{% ref install-dapr-cli.md %}}).


## Quickstarts

| Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | What You'll Learn |
