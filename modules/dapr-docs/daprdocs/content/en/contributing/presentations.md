We encourage community members to give presentations on Dapr. To get you started quickly, we offer two PowerPoint files:

- *dapr-workflow.pptx*, this is a dedicated slide deck about Dapr workflow and contains; durable execution concept, workflow authoring, workflow patterns, workflow management, and challenges & tips.

There is a downloadable zip file contains both slide decks.
