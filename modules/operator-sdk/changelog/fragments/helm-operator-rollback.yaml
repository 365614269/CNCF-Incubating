      For Helm-based operators, whenever the operator encounters an 
      error during reconcilliation, it would attempt to rollback the
      changes with the `--force` option. This behavior could have 
      undesired side effects in some scenario.

      This change allows the users to change this behavior by adding the 
      annotation, `helm.sdk.operatorframework.io/rollback-force: false`
       to the custom resource.
