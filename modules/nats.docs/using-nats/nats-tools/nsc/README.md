# nsc

NATS account configurations are built using the `nsc` tool. The NSC tool allows you to:

* Create and edit Operators, Accounts, Users
* Manage publish and subscribe permissions for Users
* Define Service and Stream exports from an account
* Reference Service and Streams from another account 
* Generate Activation tokens that grants access to a private service or stream
* Generate User credential files
* Describe Operators, Accounts, Users, and Activations
* Push and pull account JWTs to an account JWTs server

## Installation

Installing `nsc` is easy:

```shell
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nats-io/nsc/master/install.py | python
```
> Additional ways of installing nsc are described at [nsc's github repository](https://github.com/nats-io/nsc#install)

The script will download the latest version of `nsc` and install it into your system.

In case NSC is not initialized already do `nsc init`

Output of `tree -L 2 nsc/`
```text
nsc/
├── accounts
│   ├── nats
│   └── nsc.json
└── nkeys
