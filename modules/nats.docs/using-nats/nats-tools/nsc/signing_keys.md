# Signing Keys

As previously discussed, NKEYs are identities, and if someone gets a hold of an account or operator nkey they can do everything you can do as you.

NATS has strategies to let you deal with scenarios where your private keys escape out in the wild.

The first and most important line of defense is _Signing Keys_. _Signing Keys_ allow you have multiple NKEY identities of the same kind \(Operator or Account\) that have the same degree of trust as the standard _Issuer_ nkey.

The concept behind the signing key is that you can issue a JWT for an operator or an account that lists multiple nkeys. Typically the issuer will match the _Subject_ of the entity issuing the JWT. With SigningKeys, a JWT is considered valid if it is signed by the _Subject_ of the _Issuer_ or one of its signing keys. This enables guarding the private key of the Operator or Account more closely while allowing _Accounts_, _Users_ or _Activation Tokens_ be signed using alternate private keys.

If an issue should arise where somehow a signing key escapes into the wild, you would remove the compromised signing key from the entity, add a new one, and reissue the entity. When a JWT is validated, if the signing key is missing, the operation is rejected. You are also on the hook to re-issue all JWTs \(accounts, users, activation tokens\) that were signed with the compromised signing key.

This is effectively a large hammer. You can mitigate the process a bit by having a larger number of signing keys and then rotating the signing keys to get a distribution you can easily handle in case of a compromise. In a future release, we’ll have a revocation process were you can invalidate a single JWT by its unique JWT ID \(JTI\). For now a sledge hammer you have.

With greater security process, there’s greater complexity. With that said, `nsc` doesn’t track public or private signing keys. As these are only identities that when in use presume a manual use. That means that you the user will have to track and manage your private keys more closely.

Let’s get a feel for the workflow. We are going to:

* Create an operator with a signing key
* Create an account with a signing key
* The account will be signed using the operator’s signing key
* Create an user with the account’s signing key

All signing key operations revolve around the global `nsc` flag `-K` or `--private-key`. Whenever you want to modify an entity, you have to supply the parent key so that the JWT is signed. Normally this happens automatically but in the case of signing keys, you’ll have to supply the flag by hand.

Creating the operator:

```shell
nsc add operator O2
```
```
[ OK ] generated and stored operator key "OABX3STBZZRBHMWMIMVHNQVNUG2O3D54BMZXX5LMBYKSAPDSHIWPMMFY"
[ OK ] added operator "O2"
```

To add a signing key we have to first generate one with `nsc`:

```shell
nsc generate nkey --operator --store
```

```

OAZBRNE7DQGDYT5CSAGWDMI5ENGKOEJ57BXVU6WUTHFEAO3CU5GLQYF5
operator key stored ~/.nkeys/keys/O/AZ/OAZBRNE7DQGDYT5CSAGWDMI5ENGKOEJ57BXVU6WUTHFEAO3CU5GLQYF5.nk
```

> On a production environment private keys should be saved to a file and always referenced from the secured file.

Now we are going to edit the operator by adding a signing key with the `--sk` flag providing the generated operator public key \(the one starting with `O`\):

```shell
nsc edit operator --sk OAZBRNE7DQGDYT5CSAGWDMI5ENGKOEJ57BXVU6WUTHFEAO3CU5GLQYF5
```

```
[ OK ] added signing key "OAZBRNE7DQGDYT5CSAGWDMI5ENGKOEJ57BXVU6WUTHFEAO3CU5GLQYF5"
[ OK ] edited operator "O2"
```

Check our handy work:

```shell
nsc describe operator
```

```

Now let’s create an account called `A` and sign it with the generated operator private signing key. To sign it with the key specify the `-K` flag and the private key or a path to the private key:

```shell
nsc add account A -K ~/.nkeys/keys/O/AZ/OAZBRNE7DQGDYT5CSAGWDMI5ENGKOEJ57BXVU6WUTHFEAO3CU5GLQYF5.nk
```

```
[ OK ] generated and stored account key "ACDXQQ6KD5MVSFMK7GNF5ARK3OJC6PEICWCH5PQ7HO27VKGCXQHFE33B"
[ OK ] added account "A"
```

Let’s generate an account signing key, again we use `nk`:

```bash
nsc generate nkey --account --store
```

```

ADUQTJD4TF4O6LTTHCKDKSHKGBN2NECCHHMWFREPKNO6MPA7ZETFEEF7
account key stored ~/.nkeys/keys/A/DU/ADUQTJD4TF4O6LTTHCKDKSHKGBN2NECCHHMWFREPKNO6MPA7ZETFEEF7.nk
```

Let’s add the signing key to the account, and remember to sign the account with the operator signing key:

```shell
nsc edit account --sk ADUQTJD4TF4O6LTTHCKDKSHKGBN2NECCHHMWFREPKNO6MPA7ZETFEEF7 -K ~/.nkeys/keys/O/AZ/OAZBRNE7DQGDYT5CSAGWDMI5ENGKOEJ57BXVU6WUTHFEAO3CU5GLQYF5.nk
```

```
[ OK ] added signing key "ADUQTJD4TF4O6LTTHCKDKSHKGBN2NECCHHMWFREPKNO6MPA7ZETFEEF7"
[ OK ] edited account "A"
```
Let's take a look at the account

```shell
nsc describe account
```

```

```

We can see that the signing key `ADUQTJD4TF4O6LTTHCKDKSHKGBN2NECCHHMWFREPKNO6MPA7ZETFEEF7` was added to the account. Also the issuer is the operator signing key \(specified by the `-K`\).

Now let’s create a user and sign it with the account signing key starting with `ADUQTJD4TF4O`.

```shell
nsc add user U -K ~/.nkeys/keys/A/DU/ADUQTJD4TF4O6LTTHCKDKSHKGBN2NECCHHMWFREPKNO6MPA7ZETFEEF7.nk
```

```
[ OK ] generated and stored user key "UD47TOTKVDY4IQRGI6D7XMLZPHZVNV5FCD4CNQICLV3FXLQBY72A4UXL"
[ OK ] generated user creds file "~/.nkeys/creds/O2/A/U.creds"
[ OK ] added user "U" to account "A"
```
Check the user
```shell
nsc describe user
```

```

```

As expected, the issuer is now the signing key we generated earlier. To map the user to the actual account, an `Issuer Account` field was added to the JWT that identifies the public key of account _A_.

## Scoped Signing Keys

Scoped Signing Keys simplify user permission management. Previously if you wanted to limit the permissions of users, you had to specify permissions on a per-user basis. With scoped signing keys, you associate a signing key with a set of permissions. This configuration lives on the account JWT and is managed with the `nsc edit signing-key` command. You can add as many scoped signing keys as necessary.

To issue a user with a set of permissions, simply sign the user with the signing key having the permission set you want. The user configuration must _not_ have any permissions assigned to it.

On connect, the nats-server will assign the permissions associated with that signing key to the user. If you update the permissions associated with a signing key, the server will immediately update permissions for users signed with that key.

```shell
nsc add account A
```

```
[ OK ] generated and stored account key "ADLGEVANYDKDQ6WYXPNBEGVUURXZY4LLLK5BJPOUDN6NGNXLNH4ATPWR"
[ OK ] push jwt to account server:
       [ OK ] pushed account jwt to the account server
       > NGS created a new free billing account for your JWT, A [ADLGEVANYDKD].
       > Use the 'ngs' command to manage your billing plan.
       > If your account JWT is *not* in ~/.nsc, use the -d flag on ngs commands to locate it.
[ OK ] pull jwt from account server
[ OK ] added account "A"
```
Generate the signing key

```shell
nsc edit account -n A --sk generate
```

```
[ OK ] added signing key "AAZQXKDPOTGUCOCOGDW7HWWVR5WEGF3KYL7EKOEHW2XWRS2PT5AOTRH3"
[ OK ] push jwt to account server
[ OK ] pull jwt from account server
[ OK ] account server modifications:
       > allow wildcard exports changed from true to false
[ OK ] edited account "A"
```

Add a service to the account

```shell
nsc edit signing-key --account A --role service --sk AAZQXKDPOTGUCOCOGDW7HWWVR5WEGF3KYL7EKOEHW2XWRS2PT5AOTRH3 --allow-sub "q.>" --deny-pub ">" --allow-pub-response
```

```
[ OK ] set max responses to 1
[ OK ] added deny pub ">"
[ OK ] added sub "q.>"
[ OK ] push jwt to account server
[ OK ] pull jwt from account server
[ OK ] edited signing key "AAZQXKDPOTGUCOCOGDW7HWWVR5WEGF3KYL7EKOEHW2XWRS2PT5AOTRH3"
```

Since the signing key has a unique role name within an account, it can be subsequently used for easier referencing.

```shell
nsc add user U -K service
```

```
[ OK ] generated and stored user key "UBFRJ6RNBYJWSVFBS7O4ZW5MM6J3EPE75II3ULPVUWOUH7K7A23D3RQE"
[ OK ] generated user creds file `~/test/issue-2621/keys/creds/synadia/A/U.creds`
[ OK ] added user "U" to account "A"
```

To see the permissions for the user enter `nsc describe user` - you will see in the report that the user is scoped, and has the permissions listed. You can inspect and modify the scoped permissions with `nsc edit signing-key` - pushing updates to the account will reassign user permissions.

### Template functions

*Available as of NATS 2.9.0*

Although scoped signing keys are very useful and improve security, by limiting the scope of a particular signing key, the permissions that are set may be too rigid in multi-user setups. For example, given two users `pam` and `joe`, we may want to allow them to subscribe to their own namespaced subject in order to service requests, e.g. `pam.>` and `joe.>`. The permission _structure_ is the same between these users, but they differ in the concrete subjects which are further scoped to some property about that user.

Template functions can be used to declare the structure within a scope signing key, but utilize basic templating so that each user that is created with the signing key has user-specific subjects.

The following template functions will expand when a user is created.

- `{{name()}}` - expands to the name of the user, e.g. `pam`
- `{{subject()}}` - expands to the user public nkey value of the user, e.g. `UAC...`
- `{{account-name()}}` - expands to the signing account name, e.g. `sales`
- `{{account-subject()}}` - expands to the account public nkey value, e.g. `AXU...`
- `{{tag(key)}}` - expands `key:value` tags associated with the signing key

For example, given a scoped signing key with a templated `--allow-sub` subject:

```
nsc edit signing-key \
  --account sales \
  --role team-service \
  --sk AXUQXKDPOTGUCOCOGDW7HWWVR5WEGF3KYL7EKOEHW2XWRS2PT5AOTRH3 \
  --allow-sub "{{account-name()}}.{{tag(team)}}.{{name()}}.>" \
  --allow-pub-response
```

We can create two users in different teams.

```
nsc add user pam -K team-service --tag team:support
nsc add user joe -K team-service --tag team:leads
```

The resulting `--allow-sub` permission per user would be expanded to:

```
sales.support.pam.>
```

and

```
sales.leads.joe.>
```
