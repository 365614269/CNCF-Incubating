# Shared State

Actual file replication to multiple disks is not handled by the Streaming server. This - if required - needs to be handled by the user. For the FileStore implementation that we currently provide, the data store needs to be mounted by all servers in the FT group \(e.g. an NFS Mount, Gluster in Google Cloud or EFS in Amazon\).
