# Channels

Channels are at the heart of the NATS Streaming Server. Channels are subjects clients send data to and consume from.

_**Note: NATS Streaming server does not support wildcard for channels, that is, one cannot subscribe on `foo.*`, or `foo.>`, etc...**_

The number of channels can be limited \(and is by default\) through configuration. Messages produced to a channel are stored in a message log inside this channel.
