# Getting Started with Nex
This getting started guide will get you started deploying workloads with the new execution engine. You'll get a taste of all of the basics of Nex, including setup, installation, and developing and deploying both services and functions.

If you intend to use the secure sandbox mode, make sure you're running on a 64-bit Linux machine with virtualization enabled in the kernel.
