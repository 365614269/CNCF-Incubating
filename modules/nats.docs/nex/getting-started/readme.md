# Getting Started with Nex
This getting started guide will get your feet wet with the new execution engine. You'll get a taste of all of the basics of Nex, including setup, installation, and developing and deploying both types of workloads.

Before you go any further, make sure you're running on a 64-bit Linux machine with virtualization enabled in your kernel. Nex makes extensive use of [Firecracker](https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/), which has some pretty strict demands on its environment.
