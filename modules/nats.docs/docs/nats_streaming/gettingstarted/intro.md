# Getting Started

The best way to get the NATS Streaming Server is to use one of the pre-built release binaries which are available for OSX, Linux (x86-64/ARM), Windows.

Of course you can build the latest version of the server from the master branch. The master branch will always build and pass tests, but may not work correctly in your environment. First you will need at least Go version 1.11+ installed on your machine to build the NATS Streaming Server.
