What is referred to as 'Core NATS' is the base set of functionalities and qualities of service offered by a NATS service infrastructure where none of the `nats-server` instances are configured to enable JetStream.

The 'Core NATS' functionalities are publish/subscribe with subject-based-addressing and queuing, with 'at most once' quality of service.
