# Key/Value Store Walkthrough

## Prerequisite: enabling JetStream

If you are running a local `nats-server` stop it and restart it with JetStream enabled using `nats-server -js` (if that's not already done)

You can then check that JetStream is enabled by using

```shell
nats account info
```

```
Connection Information:

               Client ID: 6
               Client IP: 127.0.0.1
                     RTT: 64.996Âµs
       Headers Supported: true
         Maximum Payload: 1.0 MiB
           Connected URL: nats://127.0.0.1:4222
       Connected Address: 127.0.0.1:4222
     Connected Server ID: ND2XVDA4Q363JOIFKJTPZW3ZKZCANH7NJI4EJMFSSPTRXDBFG4M4C34K

JetStream Account Information:

           Memory: 0 B of Unlimited
          Storage: 0 B of Unlimited
          Streams: 0 of Unlimited
        Consumers: 0 of Unlimited 
```

If you see the below instead then JetStream is _not_ enabled

JetStream Account Information:

## Creating a KV bucket

Just like you have to create streams before you can use them, you need to first create a 'KV bucket' using `nats kv add <KV Bucket Name>`:

```shell
nats kv add my-kv
```

```
my_kv Key-Value Store Status

         Bucket Name: my-kv
         History Kept: 1
        Values Stored: 0
           Compressed: false
   Backing Store Kind: JetStream
          Bucket Size: 0 B
  Maximum Bucket Size: unlimited
   Maximum Value Size: unlimited
          Maximum Age: unlimited
     JetStream Stream: KV_my-kv
              Storage: File
```

## Storing a value

Now that we have a bucket, we can use it to 'put' (store) values at keys:

```shell
nats kv put my-kv Key1 Value1
```

which should return `Value1`

## Getting a value

Now that we have value stored at key "Key1" we can retrieve that value with a 'get':

```shell
nats kv get my-kv Key1
```

```
my-kv > Key1 created @ 12 Oct 21 20:08 UTC

Value1
```

## Deleting a value

You can always delete a Key/Value entry by using 
```shell
nats kv del my-kv Key1
```

## Atomic operations

Atomic `create` and `update` can be used for a range of design patterns. Including their use as semaphore for basic locking operations. 

E.g. a client operating on a file/document can lock it by creating a KV entry with `create` and deleting it after completing it. Setting a timeout for the `bucket` will allow for auto clearing of locks. To keep the timeout alive the client could use `update` with a revision number. Updates can also be used for concurrency control, where multiple clients can try a task, but only one should complete the results.

### Create (aka exclusive locking)
Create a lock/semaphore with the `create` operation.
```shell 
nats kv create my-kv Semaphore1 Value1
```
Only one `create` can succeed. First come first serve. All concurrent attempts will result in an error until the key is deleted
```shell 
nats kv create my-kv Semaphore1 Value1
nats: error: nats: wrong last sequence: 1: key exists
```

### Update with CAS (aka optimistic locking)
A key can be `updated` atomically through a CAS (compare and swap) operation
A CAS update takes the revision number as an additional parameter

```shell 
nats kv update my-kv Semaphore1 Value2 1
```

A second attempt with the same revision number will fail

```shell 
nats kv update my-kv Semaphore1 Value2 1
nats: error: nats: wrong last sequence: 2
```

## Watching a K/V Store

A functionality (normally not provided by Key/Value stores) available with the NATS KV Store is the ability to 'watch' a bucket (or a particular key in that bucket) and receive real-time updates to changes in the store.

For example, run `nats kv watch my-kv`: this will start a watcher on the bucket we have just created earlier. If you followed this walkthrough the last operation that happened on the key is that it was deleted. Because by default the KV bucket is set with a history size of one (i.e. it keeps only the last change) and the last operation on the bucket was a delete of the value associated with the key "Key1" that is the only thing that gets received by the watcher:

```shell
nats kv watch my-kv
```

```
[2021-10-12 13:15:03] DEL my-kv > Key1
```

Keep that `nats kv watch` running and in another window do another 'put'

```shell
nats kv put my-kv Key1 Value2
```

As soon as that command is run you will see that put event received by the watcher:

```shell
[2021-10-12 13:25:14] PUT my-kv > Key1: Value2
```

## Cleaning up

Once you are finished playing, you can easily delete the KV bucket and release the resource associated with it by using:

```shell
nats kv rm my-kv
```
