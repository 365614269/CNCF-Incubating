# Subject-Based Messaging

Fundamentally, NATS is about publishing and listening for messages. Both of these depend heavily on _Subjects_.
  
**What is a Subject?**  
At its simplest, a subject is just a string of characters that form a name that the publisher and subscriber can use to find each other. It helps scope messages into streams or topics.

### Characters allowed and recommended for subject names

For compatibility across clients and ease of maintaining configuration files, we recommend using Alphanumeric characters and `-` (dash) ASCII characters for all names created by the user. 

Non-ASCII UNICODE characters are deprecated. UTF-8 was supported tentatively but has been deprecated. Multilingual technical names create many issues for editing, configuration files, display, and cross-border collaboration. 

The rules and recommendations here apply to ALL system names, subjects, streams, durables, buckets, keys (in key value stores), as NATS will create API subjects that contain those names. NATS will enforce these constraints in most cases, but we recommend not relying on this.

**Allowed characters** Any ASCII character except `null` and  `.`,`*` and `>`
**Recommended characters:** `a` to `z`, `A` to `Z` and `0` to `9` and `-` (names are case sensitive, and cannot contain whitespace). 
**Naming Conventions** If you want to delimit words, use either CamelCase as in `MyServiceOrderCreate` or `-` as in `my-service-order-create`
**Special characters:** The period `.` (which is used to separate the tokens in the subject) and `*` and also `>` (the `*` and `>` are used as wildcards) are strictly reserved and cannot be used.
**Reserved names:** By convention subject names starting with a `$` are reserved for system use (e.g. subject names starting with `$SYS` or `$JS` or `$KV`, etc...). Many system subjects also use `_` (underscore) (e.g. _INBOX , KV_ABC, OBJ_XYZ etc.)

Good names
```markup
time.us
time.us2.east1
time.new-york
time.SanFrancisco
```

Deprecated subject names
```markup
location.Malm√∂
$location.Stockholm
_Subjects_.mysubject
```
 
Forbidden stream names
```markup
all*data
<my_stream>
service.stream.1
``` 
  
## Subject Hierarchies

The `.` character is used to create a subject hierarchy. For example, a world clock application might define the following to logically group related subjects:

```markup
time.us
time.us.east
time.us.east.atlanta
time.eu.east
time.eu.warsaw
```

## Wildcards

NATS provides two _wildcards_ that can take the place of one or more elements in a dot-separated subject. Subscribers can use these wildcards to listen to multiple subjects with a single subscription but Publishers will always use a fully specified subject, without the wildcard.

### Matching A Single Token

The first wildcard is `*` which will match a single token. For example, if an application wanted to listen for eastern time zones, they could subscribe to `time.*.east`, which would match `time.us.east` and `time.eu.east`. 
Note that `*` can not match a substring within a token `time.New*.east` will

### Matching Multiple Tokens

The second wildcard is `>` which will match one or more tokens, and can only appear at the end of the subject. For example, `time.us.>` will match `time.us.east` and `time.us.east.atlanta`, while `time.us.*` would only match `time.us.east` since it can't match more than one token.

### Monitoring and Wire Taps

Subject to your security configuration, wildcards can be used for monitoring by creating something sometimes called a _wire tap_. In the simplest case you can create a subscriber for `>`. This application will receive all messages -- again, subject to security settings -- sent on your NATS cluster.

### Mixing Wildcards

The wildcard `*` can appear multiple times in the same subject. Both types can be used as well. For example, `*.*.east.>` will receive `time.us.east.atlanta`.

## Subject Tokens

It is recommended to keep the maximum number of tokens in your subjects to a reasonable value of 16 tokens max.
