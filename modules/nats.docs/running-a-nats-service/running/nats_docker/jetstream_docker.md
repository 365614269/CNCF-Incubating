# JetStream

In one window start a JetStream enabled nats server:

```shell
docker run --network host -p 4222:4222 nats -js
```

And make sure you have the CLI tools [`nats`](../../../using-nats/nats-tools/nats\_cli/) and [`nsc`](../../../using-nats/nats-tools/nsc/) installed

Now skip to the [`Administer JetStream`](../../nats\_admin/jetstream\_admin/) section.

## Using Docker with NGS

You can join a JetStream instance to your [NGS](https://synadia.com/ngs) account, first we need a credential for testing JetStream:

You'll want to do this outside of docker to keep the credentials that are generated.

```shell
nsc add user -a YourAccount --name leafnode --expiry 1M
```

You'll get a credential file somewhere like `~/.nkeys/creds/synadia/YourAccount/leafnode.creds`, mount this file into the docker container for JetStream using `-v ~/.nkeys/creds/synadia/YourAccount/leafnode.creds:/leafnode.creds`.

```shell
docker run -ti -v ~/.nkeys/creds/synadia/YourAccount/leafnode.creds:/leafnode.creds --name jetstream nats:latest
```
