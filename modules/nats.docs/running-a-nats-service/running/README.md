# Running

The nats-server has many command line options. To get started, you don't have to specify anything. In the absence of any flags, the NATS server will start listening for NATS client connections on port 4222. By default, security is disabled.

## Standalone

When the server starts it will print some information including where the server is listening for client connections:

```shell
nats-server
```

## Docker

If you are running your NATS server in a docker container:

```shell
docker run -p 4222:4222 -ti nats:latest
```

## Running nats-server as a systemd service on Linux
You can easily and quickly use `systemd` to start (and restart if needed) the `nats-server` process. 

Please see the example files located in the `util` directory of the [nats-server repo](https://github.com/nats-io/nats-server/tree/main/util) that you can use to generate your own `/etc/systemd/system/nats.service` file.

## JetStream

Remember that in order to enable JetStream and all the functionalities that use it you need to enable it on at least one of your servers

### Command Line

Enable JetStream by specifying the `-js` flag when starting the NATS server.

`$ nats-server -js`

### Configuration File

You can also enable JetStream through a configuration file. By default, the JetStream subsytem will store data in the /tmp directory. Here's a minimal file that will store data in a local "nats" directory, suitable for development and local testing.

```shell
nats-server -c js.conf
```

```text
# js.conf
jetstream {
   store_dir=nats
}
```

Normally JetStream will be run in clustered mode and will replicate data, so the best place to store JetStream data would be locally on a fast SSD. One should specifically avoid NAS or NFS storage for JetStream.
