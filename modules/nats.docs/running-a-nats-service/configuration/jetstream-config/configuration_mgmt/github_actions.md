# GitHub Actions

We have a pack of GitHub Actions that let you manage an already running JetStream Server, useful for managing releases or standing up test infrastructure.

Full details and examples are in the [jetstream-gh-actions](https://github.com/nats-io/jetstream-gh-action) repository, here's an example.

```yaml
on: push
name: orders
jobs:

  # First we delete the ORDERS stream and consumer if they already exist
  clean_orders:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: orders_stream
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action/delete/stream@master
        with:
          missing_ok: 1
          stream: ORDERS
          server: js.example.net

  # Now we create the Stream and Consumers using the same configuration files the 
  # nats CLI utility would use as shown above
  create_orders:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: clean_orders
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: orders_stream
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action/create/stream@master
        with:
          config: ORDERS.json
          server: js.example.net
      - name: orders_new_consumer
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action/create/consumer@master
        with:
          config: ORDERS_NEW.json
          stream: ORDERS
          server: js.example.net

  # We publish a message to a specific Subject, perhaps some consumer is 
  # waiting there for it to kick off tests
  publish_message:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: create_orders
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: orders_new_consumer
        uses: nats-io/jetstream-gh-action@master
        with:
          subject: ORDERS.deployment
          message: Published new deployment via "${{ github.event_name }}" in "${{ github.repository }}"
          server: js.example.net
```
