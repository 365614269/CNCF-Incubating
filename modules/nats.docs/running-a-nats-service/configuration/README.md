# Configuration

While the NATS server has many flags that allow for simple testing of features from command line. The standard way of configuring the NATS server product is through a configuration file. 
We use a simple configuration format that combines the best of traditional formats and newer styles such as JSON and YAML.

```shell
nats-server -config my-server.conf
```

The NATS configuration supports the following syntax:

- Lines can be commented with `#` and `//`
- Values can be assigned to properties with delimiters:
  - Equals sign: `foo = 2`
  - Colon: `foo: 2`
  - Whitespace: `foo 2`
- Arrays are enclosed in brackets: `["a", "b", "c"]`
- Maps are enclosed in braces: `{foo: 2}`
- Maps can be assigned with no delimiter `accounts { SYS {...}, cloud-user {...} }`  
- Semicolons can be optionally used as terminators `host: 127.0.0.1; port: 4222;`

The NATS configuration file is parsed with UTF-8 encoding. 

{% hint style="info" %}
We strongly recommend using only ASCII for names and values, limiting the use of Unicode, no ASCII text to comments.
{% endhint %}

#### Note

The NATS configuration in the file can also be rendered as a JSON object (with comments!), but to combine it with variables the variables still have to be unquoted.

{% hint style="info" %}
JSON config files should be limited machine generated configuration files
{% endhint %}

## Strings and Numbers

The configuration parser is very forgiving, as you have seen:

- values can be a primitive, or a list, or a map
- strings and numbers typically do the right thing
- numbers support units such as, 1K for 1000, 1KB for 1024

String values that start with a digit _can_ create issues. To force such values as strings, quote them.

_BAD Config_:

```text
listen: 127.0.0.1:4222
authorization: {
    # Bad - Number parsing error
    token: 3secret
}
```

Fixed Config:

```text
listen: 127.0.0.1:4222
authorization: {
    # Good
    token: "3secret"
}
```

## Variables

Server configurations can specify variables. Variables allow you to reference a value from one or more sections in the configuration.



**Variables syntax:**

* Are block-scoped
* Are referenced with a `$` prefix. Variables in quotes blocks are ignored. For example, a usage like `foo = "$VAR1"` will result in `foo` being the literal string `"$VAR1"`.
* Variables MUST be used to be recognized as such. The config parser will distinguish `unknown field` from variable by finding a reference to the variable. 
* Variable reference which are not defined will be resolved from environment variables.

**Variable resolution sequence:** 
* Look for variable in same scope
* Look for variable in parent scopes
* Look for variable in enviroment variables
* If not found stop server startup with the error below

`nats-server: variable reference for 'PORT' on line 5 can not be found`

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the environment variable value begins with a number you may have trouble resolving it depending on the server version you are running.
{% endhint %}


```text
# Define a variable in the config
TOKEN: "secret"

# Reference the variable
authorization {
    token: $TOKEN
}
```

```text
# Define a variable in the config
# But TOKEN is never used resulting in a config parsing error
TOKEN: "secret"

# Reference the variable
authorization {
    token: "another secret"
}
```
```shell
unknown field "TOKEN"
```

A similar configuration, but this time, the variable is resolved from the environment:
```shell
export TOKEN="hello"
nats-server -c /config/file
```

```text
# TOKEN is defined in the environment
authorization {
    token: $TOKEN
}
```



## Include Directive

The `include` directive allows you to split a server configuration into several files. This is useful for separating configuration into chunks that you can easily reuse between different servers.

Includes _must_ use relative paths, and are relative to the main configuration \(the one specified via the `-c` option\):

server.conf:

```text
listen: 127.0.0.1:4222
include ./auth.conf
```

> Note that `include` is not followed by `=` or `:`, as it is a _directive_.

auth.conf:

```text
authorization: {
    token: "f0oBar"
}
```

```text
> nats-server -c server.conf
```

## Configuration Reloading

The config file is being read by the server on startup and is not re-scanned for changes and not locked. 

A server can reload most configuration changes without requiring a server restart or clients to disconnect by sending the nats-server a [signal](/running-a-nats-service/nats_admin/signals.md):

```shell
nats-server --signal reload
```

As of NATS v2.10.0, a reload signal can be sent on a NATS service using a system account user, where `<server-id>` is the unique ID of the server be targeted.

```shell
nats --user sys --password sys request '$SYS.REQ.SERVER.<server-id>.RELOAD' ""
```


## Configuration Properties

Config files have the following structure (in no specific order). All blocks and properties are optional (except host and port). 

Please see sections below for links to detailed explanations of each configuration block

```text
#General settings
host: 0.0.0.0
port: 4222

# Various server level options
# ...

# The following sections are maps with a set of (nested) properties

jetstream {

    # Configuration map for tls parameters used for client connections, 
    # routes and https monitoring connections.

}

resolver {
    # Pointer to external Authentication/Authorization resolver
    # There are multiple possible resolver type explained in their own chapters of this docuemntaion
    # memory, nats-base, url ... more may be added in the future
    # This parameter can be a value `MEMORY` for simple configuration
    # or a map of properties for connecting to the resolver
}

resolver_tls {
    # TLS configuration for an URL based resolver

| `max_control_line`  | Maximum length of a protocol line \(including combined length of subject and queue group\). Increasing this value may require [client changes](/using-nats/developing-with-nats/connecting/misc.md#set-the-maximum-control-line-size) to be used. Applies to all traffic.                                                                                                                                     | `4KB`          |
| `max_payload`       | Maximum number of bytes in a message payload. Reducing this size may force you to implement [chunking](/using-nats/developing-with-nats/connecting/misc.md#get-the-maximum-payload-size) in your clients. Applies to client and leafnode payloads. It is not recommended to use values over 8MB but `max_payload` can be set up to 64MB. The max payload must be equal to or smaller than the `max_pending` value. | `1MB`          |
| `max_pending`       | Maximum number of bytes buffered for a connection. Applies to client connections. Note that applications can also set 'PendingLimits' (number of messages and total size) for their subscriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | `64MB`         |
| `max_subscriptions` | Maximum numbers of subscriptions per client and leafnode accounts connection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | `0`, unlimited |

### JetStream

You can enable JetStream in the server's configuration by simply adding a `jetstream {}` map.
By default, the JetStream subsystem will store data in the /tmp directory, but you can specify the directory to use via the `store_dir`, as well as the limits for JetStream storage (a value of 0 means no limit).

Normally JetStream will be run in clustered mode and will replicate data, so the best place to store JetStream data would be locally on a fast SSD. One should specifically avoid NAS or NFS storage for JetStream. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that each JetStream enabled server MUST use its own individual storage directory.  Jetstream replicates data between cluster nodes (up to 5 replicas), achieving redundancy and availability through this.

Jetstream does not implement standby and fault tolerance through a shared file system. If a standby server shares a storage dir with an active server, you must make sure only one is active at any time. Access conflicts are not detected. We do not recommend such a setup.
{% endhint %}


Here's an example minimal file that will store data in a local "nats" directory with some limits.

`$ nats-server -c js.conf`

```text
jetstream {
  store_dir: nats

  # 1GB
  max_memory_store: 1073741824

  # 10GB
  max_file_store: 10737418240
}
```

### Authentication and Authorization

#### Centralized Authentication and Authorization

A default nats server will have no authentication or authorization enabled. This is useful for development and simple embedded use cases only. The default account is `$G`.

Once at least one user is configured in the authorization or accounts sections the default $G account an no-authentication user are disabled. You can restore no authentication access by setting the `no_auth_user`.
