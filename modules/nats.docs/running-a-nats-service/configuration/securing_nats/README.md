# Securing NATS

The NATS server provides several forms of security:

* Connections can be [_encrypted_ with TLS](/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/tls.md)
* Client connections can require [_authentication_](/running-a-nats-service/configuration/securing_nats/auth_intro)
* Clients can require [_authorization_](authorization.md) for subjects they publish or subscribe to
