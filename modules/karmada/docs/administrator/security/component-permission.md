# Karmada Component Permissions

This document provides a detailed explanation of the resources each Karmada component needs to access and the reasons for these accesses. It will help administrators understand and configure the RBAC permissions needed for Karmada components effectively, ensuring that the system operates securely and efficiently.
The [installation tools](https://karmada.io/docs/installation/) maintained by the community are designed with security in mind. These tools use Role-Based Access Control ([RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)) to manage access to components, ensuring they only have access to the resources they require. By adhering to the principle of least privilege, these tools minimize potential security risks and prevent unauthorized access or actions within the system.

## karmada-operator

### Introduction:

The Karmada operator is a method for installing, upgrading, and deleting Karmada instances. It builds upon the basic Karmada resource and controller concepts, provides convenience to centrally manage entire lifecycle of Karmada instances in a global cluster.

### Resources in Karmada System

NONE.

## karmada-agent

### Introduction:

karmada-agent can register a specific cluster to the Karmada control plane and sync manifests from the Karmada control plane to the member cluster. In addition, it also syncs the status of member cluster and manifests to the Karmada control plane.

### Resources in Karmada System

In the following table, `{{cluster_name}}` represents the name of the member cluster that has been registered by the karmada-agent, and `{{cluster_namespace}}` indicates the namespace where the secrets resource of the member cluster is deployed, which is `karmada-cluster` by default.
