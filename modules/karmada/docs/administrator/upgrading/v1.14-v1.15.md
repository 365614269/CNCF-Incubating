- Introduced `ComponentResource` field to `ResourceInterpreterCustomization` API to hold rules for discovering the resource requirements of workloads consisting of multiple components.
- Introduced `spec.crdTarball.httpSource.proxy` field to `Karmada` API to optionally set a proxy for downloading CRD tarballs from an HTTP source.
- Introduced `spec.failover.cluster` field to the `PropagationPolicy` API for application-level cluster failover.
