Today we announce the release of **Falco 0.36.1** ü¶Ö!

## Fixes

Falco's 0.36.1 release is a small patch aimed at protecting our uses by addressing a few minor bugs. It includes the following:

* Address a **HIGH** severity vulnerability in libcurl **[CVE-2023-38545](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html)**, bumping the library to the patched version `8.4.0`. You can find more details in the [section below](#vulnerability-in-libcurl).
* The legacy eBPF probe can now handle systems with CPU hotplug enabled, opening the right number of kernel buffers. (https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/2843)
* Remove a no longer useful experimental Falco config `outputs_queue.recovery`. This was introduced in Falco `0.36.0` as an experiment.
* Fix a possible segfault caused by a faulty implementation of [`timer_delete`](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/+bug/1940296). (https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/2850)

Thanks to everyone in the community for helping us in spotting these annoying bugs üêõ! You make Falco successful ü¶Ö!

Thanks as always to the Falco maintainers for their support and effort during the entire release process.

### Vulnerability in libcurl

A **HIGH** severity vulnerability in libcurl, **[CVE-2023-38545](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html)**, was disclosed alongside a patched version (`8.4.0`). We would like to answer the main question you might have about it: **Does it affect Falco?**

According to the excellent [in-depth description](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2023/10/11/how-i-made-a-heap-overflow-in-curl/) of the bug, this can only be triggered if **both conditions below** are true:
* A **SOCKS5 HTTP(S) proxy has been configured**. This happens if you have set the standard environment variables that control proxy connections, such as `http_proxy`/`https_proxy`/`no_proxy` or libcurl-specific ones as indicated in the [advisory](https://curl.se/docs/CVE-2023-38545.html) or the libcurl documentation.
* An **attacker controls** the server that Falco is connecting to, namely the **server configured to receive http_output** or a **custom prebuilt driver repository server**, and the SOCKS5 proxy is "slow enough" to allow the attack to happen.

While it may be rare that users have an exploitable environment, it's still a possibility. For this reason, Falco maintainers decided to ship this patch release ü¶Ö

## Try it! üèéÔ∏è

As usual, in case you just want to try out the stable **Falco 0.36.1**, you can install its packages following the process outlined in the docs:

* [CentOS/Amazon Linux](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#centos-rhel)
* [Debian/Ubuntu](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#debian)
* [openSUSE](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#suse)
* [Linux binary package](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/installation/#linux-binary)

Prefer to use a container image? No problem at all! üê≥

You can read more about running Falco with Docker in the [docs](https://falco.org/docs/getting-started/running/#docker).

You can also find the Falcosecurity container images on the public AWS ECR gallery:

* [falco](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco)
* [falco-no-driver](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-no-driver)
* [falco-driver-loader](https://gallery.ecr.aws/falcosecurity/falco-driver-loader)

## What next? üîÆ

The community is active on many topics and we hope to deliver great features and many stability fixes once again during the next release cycle!

- The old `falco-driver-loader` script is showing its age and it's time to work on a more maintainable solution. `falcoctl` is a great candidate to host everything driver related, implement new features and make our lives easier when we need to install Falco drivers on a new machine.
- Lately we have expanded the syscall coverage that Falco can provide. We wish to improve these efforts across all drivers with even more 32 bit syscalls.
- Our rule framework is brand new and we forsee many improvements and active development work on it.
- The latest Falco versions brought many improvements to the plugin framework; we wish to use those to create a more scalable Kubernetes client plugin that will be able to withstand much heavier loads and will be easier to maintain.

And many, many, more enhancements!
