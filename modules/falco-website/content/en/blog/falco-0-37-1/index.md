Today we announce the release of **Falco 0.37.1** ü¶Ö!

## Fixes

Falco's 0.37.1 release is a small patch aimed at addressing a few minor bugs. It includes the following:

* Added `--http-insecure` flag to driver loader images
* Added new env variable `FALCOCTL_DRIVER_HTTP_HEADERS` understood by driver loader images to pass a comma separated list of http headers for driver download, eg: `FALCOCTL_DRIVER_HTTP_HEADERS='x-emc-namespace: default,Proxy-Authenticate: Basic'`
* Falcoctl was bumped to v0.7.2, fixing an [issue building Flatcar drivers](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl/pull/425) and a bug withing the [kernel release fixup method](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl/pull/427) to build drivers download URLs
* Fixed a nasty bug that caused Falco to crash when a `priority` higher than `debug` was set in the config: https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/3060
* Libs were updated to 0.14.3

Last, but not least, as recommended by the CNCF, **we now link `libelf` dynamically** instead of statically, so that the library remains separable from Falco at runtime.  
This has multiple outcomes:
* Falco static (musl) build is disabled for now; we are experimenting with some solutions and we will hopefully be able to bring it back up soon
* Users of docker images won't notice anything since they already shipped `libelf` library
* Users of `deb` and `rpm` packages won't notice anything since `libelf` was already a nested dependency
* **Users of the `tar.gz` package will need to manually install `libelf` where not present**

Thanks to everyone in the community for helping us in spotting these annoying bugs üêõ! You make Falco successful ü¶Ö!

Thanks as always to the Falco maintainers for their support and effort during the entire release process.
