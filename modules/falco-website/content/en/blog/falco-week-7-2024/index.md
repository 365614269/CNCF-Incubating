### [Kernel-testing](https://github.com/falcosecurity/kernel-testing)

Even if the effort was part of last week, and since we skipped last "Weekly Recap", it is important to mention that the kernel-testing framework recently got a big update:
* All images build is now tested in PR CI when they are modified
* Images are now build and published on `ghcr.io/falcosecurity/kernel-testing` repo
* They are published under `main` tag and under `latest|$tag` for releases
* The image name is built as: `$distro-{kernel,image}:$kernelrelease-$arch-$imagetag`, eg: `amazonlinux2-kernel:5.10-x86_64-v0.3.2`
* Ubuntu-6.3 images were bumped to 6.5 kernel
* A new arch-6.7 image was added to the test matrix
* A [composite](https://github.com/falcosecurity/kernel-testing/blob/main/action.yml) action was added and is now used by libs CI

As always, you can find detailed kernel-testing outputs against our drivers under https://falcosecurity.github.io/libs/matrix/.

### [Charts](https://github.com/falcosecurity/charts)
