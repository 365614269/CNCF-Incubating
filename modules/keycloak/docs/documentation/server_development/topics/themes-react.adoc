== Themes based on React

The admin console and account console are based on React.
To fully customize these you can use the React based npm packages.
There are two packages:

* `@keycloak/keycloak-admin-ui`: This is the base theme for the admin console.
* `@keycloak/keycloak-account-ui`: This is the base theme for the account console.

Both packages are available on npm.

=== Installing the packages

To install the packages, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pnpm install @keycloak/keycloak-account-ui
----

=== Using the packages

To use these pages you'll need to add KeycloakProvider in your component hierarchy to setup what client, realm and url to use.

[source,javascript]
----
import { KeycloakProvider } from "@keycloak/keycloak-ui-shared";

//...

<KeycloakProvider environment={{
      serverBaseUrl: "http://localhost:8080",
      realm: "master",
      clientId: "security-admin-console"
  }}>
  {/* rest of you application */}
</KeycloakProvider>
----

=== Translating the pages

The pages are translated using the `i18next` library.
You can set it up as described on their [website](https://react.i18next.com/).
If you want to use the translations that are provided then you need to add i18next-http-backend to your project and add:

[source,javascript]
----
backend: {
  loadPath: `http://localhost:8080/resources/master/account/{lng}}`,
  parse: (data: string) => {
    const messages = JSON.parse(data);

    const result: Record<string, string> = {};
    messages.forEach((v) => (result[v.key] = v.value)); //need to convert to record
    return result;
  },
},
----

=== Using the pages

All "pages" are React components that can be used in your application.
To see what components are available, see the [source](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/blob/main/js/apps/account-ui/src/index.ts).
Or have a look at the [quick start](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts/tree/main/extension/extend-account-console-node) to see how to use them.
