= Policy enforcers

Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) is a design pattern and as such you can implement it in different ways. {project_name} provides all the necessary means to implement PEPs for different
platforms, environments, and programming languages. {project_name} Authorization Services presents a RESTful API and leverages OAuth2 authorization capabilities for fine-grained
authorization using a centralized authorization server.

The Policy enforcers available by {project_name} are:

* {securing_apps_java_policy_enforcer_link}[{securing_apps_java_policy_enforcer_name}] - useful to be used in the Java client applications
* <<_enforcer_js_adapter, Javascript Policy enforcer>> - useful to be used in the applications secured by {project_name} Javascript adapter
