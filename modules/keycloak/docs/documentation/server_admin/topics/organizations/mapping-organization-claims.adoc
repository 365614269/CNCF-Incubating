=  Mapping organization claims
[role="_abstract"]
When authenticating in the context of an organization, the access token is automatically updated with specific claims
about the organization where the user is a member.

To map organization-specific claims into tokens, a client needs to request the *organization* scope when sending
authorization requests to the server.

As a result, the token will contain a claim as follows:

```json
"organization": {
  "acme": {}
}
```

The organization claim can be used by clients (for example, from ID Tokens) and resource servers (for example, from access tokens)
to authorize access to protected resources based on the organization where the user is a member.

The organization scope is a built-in optional client scope at the realm.  Therefore, this scope is added to any client created
in the realm, by default.
