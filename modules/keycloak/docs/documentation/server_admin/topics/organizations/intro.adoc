When integrating with a third party like a customer or business partner, you might want to manage their identities
separately from others and build a unified and secure experience throughout your business ecosystem when they interact
with a realm.

In a realm, an *organization* represents these third parties so that a realm or an organization administrator can manage
the entire lifecycle of its members and how they authenticate and authorize to a realm, on a per-organization basis.

The organization is the entry point to start using the IAM capabilities of {project_name} to also address Business-to-Business (B2B) use cases.
It enables multi-tenancy within a realm so that users can have access to protected resources from a realm but with a more restricted
and controlled context. The organization they belong to.

{project_name} Organizations is a feature that enables support for organizations in {project_name}. For now, it provides
some of the core capabilities needed to manage organizations such as:

* Manage members
* Onboard organization members using invitation links
* Onboard organization members by federating their identities through identity brokering
* Identity-first login and organization-specific steps when authenticating in the scope of an organization
* Propagate organization-specific claims to applications through tokens for authorization purposes
