=  Managing identity providers
[role="_abstract"]

An organization might have its own identity provider as the single source of truth for their identities. In this case,
you want to configure the organization to authenticate users using the organization's identity provider, federate their
identities, and finally add them as a member of the organization.

An organization can have one or more identity providers associated with it so that they can authenticate their users from
different sources and enforce different constraints on each of them.

Before you can link an identity provider to an organization, you create an organization at the realm level from the *Identity Providers*
section in the menu. You can link any of the built-in social and identity providers available in the realm to an organization.

== Linking an identity provider to an organization

An identity provider can be linked to an organization from the *Identity providers* tab. If identity providers already exist, you see a list of them and options to search, edit, or unlink from the organization.

An identity provider has the following settings:

Identity provider::
The identity provider you want to link to the organization. An identity provider can only be linked to a single organization.

Domain::
The domain from the organization that you want to link with the identity provider.

Hide on login page::
If this identity provider should be hidden in login pages when the user is authenticating in the scope of the organization.

Redirect when email domain matches::
If members should be automatically redirected to the identity provider when their email domain matches the domain set to the identity provider.

Once linked to an organization, the identity provider can be managed just like any other in a realm by accessing the *Identity Providers* section in the menu. However, the options herein described are only available when managing the identity provider in the scope of an organization. The only exception is the
 *Hide on login page* option that is present here for convenience.
