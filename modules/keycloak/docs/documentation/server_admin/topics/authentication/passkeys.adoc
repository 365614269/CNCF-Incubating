=== Passkeys

{project_name} provides preview support for https://fidoalliance.org/passkeys/[Passkeys]. {project_name} works as a Passkeys Relying Party (RP).

Passkey registration and authentication are realized by the features of xref:webauthn_{context}[WebAuthn].
Therefore, users of {project_name} can do passkey registration and authentication by existing xref:webauthn_{context}[WebAuthn registraton and authentication].

[NOTE]
====
Both synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys can be used for both Same-Device and Cross-Device Authentication (CDA).
However, passkeys operations success depends on the user's environment. Make sure which operations can succeed in https://passkeys.dev/device-support/[the environment].
