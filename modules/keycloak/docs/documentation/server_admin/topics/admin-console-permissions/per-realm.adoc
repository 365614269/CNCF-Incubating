=== Dedicated realm admin consoles

Each realm has a dedicated Admin Console that can be accessed by going to the url `{kc_admins_path}/{realm-name}/console`.
Users within that realm can be granted realm management permissions by assigning specific user role mappings.

Each realm has a built-in client called `realm-management`.  You can view this client by going to the
`Clients` left menu item of your realm.  This client defines client-level roles that specify permissions that can be granted to manage the realm.

* create-client
* impersonation
* manage-authorization
* manage-clients
* manage-events
* manage-identity-providers
* manage-realm
* manage-users
* query-clients
* query-groups
* query-realms
* query-users
* realm-admin
* view-authorization
* view-clients
* view-events
* view-identity-providers
* view-realm
* view-users

Assign the roles you want to your users and they will only be able to use that specific part of the administration console.
