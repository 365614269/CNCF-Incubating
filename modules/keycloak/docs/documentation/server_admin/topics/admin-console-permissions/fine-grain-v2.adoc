[[_fine_grained_permissions]]

=== Fine grained admin permissions V2

With fine-grained admin permissions, you can delegate realm management to other administrators, the realm administrators.
Different from the regular Role-Based Access Control Mechanism provided through the Global and Realm specific roles
(<<_master_realm_access_control, Master realm access control>>), this feature provides a more fine-grained control over
how realm resources can be accessed and managed based on a well-defined set of operations that can be performed on them.

By relying on a Policy-Based Access Control, server administrators can define permissions to realm resources such as users,
groups, and clients, using different policy types, or access control methods, so that a realm administrator is limited to
access a subset of realm resources and their operations.

Here are some key points to understand about fine-grained admin permissions:

* Fine grained admin permissions are only available within <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, dedicated admin consoles>> or
  realm-specific admin APIs and administrators defined within those realms. You cannot define cross-realm fine grained permissions.
* Fine grained admin permissions are used to grant additional permissions. You cannot override the default behavior of the
  built-in admin roles.
* Fine-grained admin permissions V2 do not support federated resources. This restriction is a known limitation under consideration
  for future improvement.

[NOTE]
====
To maximize the effectiveness of fine-grained admin permissions while minimizing the impact of broad admin roles,
it is recommended to assign the *query-clients*, *query-groups*, and *query-users* roles (along with roles required
for realm management) to allow querying. All other administrative access could be managed through fine-grained permissions.
See <<_realm_access_control, Accessing a Realm Admin Console as a Realm Administrator>> for more information.

==== Understanding the Realm Resource Types

In a realm, you can manage different types of resources such as users, groups, clients, client scopes, roles, and so on.
As a realm administrator, you are constantly managing these resources to manage your identities and how they authenticate
and authorize to a realm and your applications.

This feature provides the necessary mechanisms to enforce access controls when managing realm resources, limited to:

* Users
* Groups
* Clients
* Roles

It allows you to manage permissions for all resources of a given resource type, such as all users in a realm, or
for a specific realm resource, such as a specific user or set of users in the realm.

Each realm resource supports a well-defined set of management operations, or actions, that can be performed on them,
such as view, manage, and resource-specific operations such as view-members if you take groups as an example.

===== Users Resource Type

The *Users* realm resource type represents the users in a realm. You can manage permissions for users based on the following
set of management operations:

[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Operation*                | *Description*

| *view*                    | Defines if a realm administrator can view users.
| *manage*                  | Defines if a realm administrator can manage users.
| *manage-group-membership* | Defines if a realm administrator can assign or anassign users into groups.
| *map-roles*               | Defines if a realm administrator can assign or anassign roles to users.
| *impersonate*             | Defines if a realm administrator can impersonate other users.
|===

[NOTE]
====
- The *view* operation also considers group-related permissions, specifically *view-members* for viewing group members.
  The evaluation takes permissions for specific resources (specific user permissions and specific group permissions) first.
  See <<_resolving-conflicting-permissions, Resolving Conflicting Permissions>> for more information.
- The *manage* operation takes *manage-members* into account when managing group members.
- The *impersonate* operation takes *impersonate-members* into account when managing group members.
====

===== Groups Resource Type

The *Groups* realm resource type represents the groups in a realm. You can manage permissions for groups based on the following
set of management operations:

[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Operation*                | *Description*

| *view*                    | Defines if a realm administrator can view groups.
| *manage*                  | Defines if a realm administrator can manage groups.
| *view-members*            | Defines if a realm administrator can view group members.
| *manage-members*          | Defines if a realm administrator can manage group members.
| *impersonate-members*     | Defines if a realm administrator can impersonate group members.
| *manage-membership*       | Defines if a realm administrator can add or remove members from groups.
|===

[NOTE]
====
- The *view-members* and *manage-members* operations apply to the entire group hierarchy. In other words, if an administrator has
  permission to manage members of a group, they can also manage members of all its subgroups. This can be prevented by
  explicitly denying permission for specific subgroups.
====

===== Clients Resource Type

The *Clients* realm resource type represents the clients in a realm. You can manage permissions for clients based on the following
set of management operations:

[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Operation*                | *Description*

| *view*                    | Defines if a realm administrator can view clients.
| *manage*                  | Defines if a realm administrator can manage clients.
| *map-roles*               | Defines if a realm administrator can assign any role defined by a client (or multiple clients) to a user.
| *map-roles-composite*     | Defines if a realm administrator can assign any role defined by a client (or multiple clients) as a composite to
                              another role.
| *map-roles-client-scope*  | Defines if a realm administrator can assign any role defined by a client (or multiple clients) to the scope of
                              another client.
|===

[NOTE]
====
- The *map-roles* operation does not grant the ability to manage users or assign roles arbitrarily; the administrator must also
  have user role mapping permissions.
====

===== Roles Resource Type

The *Roles* realm resource type represents the roles in a realm. You can manage permissions for roles based on the following set of management operations:

[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Operation*               | *Description*

| *map-role*               | Defines if a realm administrator can assign a role (or multiple roles) to a user.
| *map-role-composite*     | Defines if a realm administrator can assign a role (or multiple roles) as a composite to another role.
| *map-role-client-scope*  | Defines if a realm administrator can apply a role (or multiple roles) to an another clientâ€™s scope.
|===

[NOTE]
====
* The *map-role* operation does not grant the ability to manage users or assign roles arbitrarily; the administrator must also have
  user role mapping permissions.
* When mapping client roles, if an administrator has permission to *map-roles*, *map-roles-composite*, or *map-roles-client-scope* for
  a client, permissions for specific roles within that client are not evaluated.

==== Enabling admin permissions to a realm

To enable fine-grained admin permissions in a realm, follow these steps:

* Log in to the Admin Console.
* Click *Realm settings*.
* Enable *Admin Permissions* and click *Save*.

image:images/fine-grain-enable.png[Fine grain enable]

Once enabled, a *Permissions* section appears in the left-side menu of the administration console.

image:images/fine-grain-permissions-tab.png[Fine grain permissions tab]

==== Managing Permissions

The *Permissions* tab provides an overview of all active permissions within a realm. From here, administrators can create,
update, delete, or search for permissions.

To create a permission, click on the `Create permission` button and select the resource type you want to protect.

image:images/select-resource-type.png[Selecting a resource type to protect]

Once you select the resource type, you can now define how access should be enforced for a set of one or more resources of the selected type:

image:images/create-permission.png[Creating a permission]

When managing a permission you can define the following settings:

* *Name*: A unique name for the permission. The name should also not conflict with any policy name
* *Description*: An optional description to better describe what the permission is about
* *Authorization scopes*: A set of one or more scopes representing the operations you want to protect for the selected resource type.
An administrator must have explicit permission assigned for each operation to perform the corresponding action. For example,
assigning only *manage* without *view* will prevent the user from being visible.
* *Enforce access to*: Defines if the permission should enforce access to all resources of the selected type or to specific resources in a realm.
* *Policies*: Defines a set of one or more policies that should be evaluated to grant or deny access to the selected resource(s).

==== Managing Policies

The *Policies* tab allows administrators to define conditions using different access control methods to determine whether
a permission should be granted to an administrator attempting to perform operations on a realm resource. When managing permissions,
you must associate at least a single policy to grant or deny access to a realm resource.

Policies are basically conditions that will evaluate to either a `GRANT` or a `DENY`. Their outcome will decide whether
a permission should be granted or denied. A permission is only granted  if all its associated policies evaluate to a `GRANT`.
Otherwise, the permission is denied and a realm administrator will not be able to access the protected resource.

{project_name} provides a set of built-in policies that you can choose from:

image:images/select-policy-type.png[Selecting a policy type]

For more details about each policy type, take a look at link:{authorizationguide_link}#_policy_overview[Managing policies].

==== Evaluating Permissions

The *Evaluation* tab provides a testing environment where administrators can verify that permissions are correctly enforcing access
control as expected.

The administrator could see what permissions were involved in evaluation and what the outcome is by specifying a `username` of a user they
want to verify, *Resource type*, resource (usermane of a *User* in this case) and optionally an authorization scope.

image:images/fine-grain-evaluation.png[Fine grained permissions evaluation tab]

In the example above it is visible that the user `myadmin`, can *manage* user `user-1`. There is also information what permissions were involved
in the evaluation, what outcome it had and what scopes were granted or denied.

===== Defining permissions for viewing realm resources

When listing or searching for realm resources (such as clients, groups, or users) via the Admin Console or Admin API, {project_name}
evaluates permissions that contain the *view* scope for the specific resource. For this operation, only role, user, and group policy types are
considered, while other policy types are ignored due to partial evaluation performed at the database level. Because of this, only policies that
reference the resource directlyâ€”whether through user association, group membership, or role assignmentâ€”are found and permissions associated with
those are used to filter the resources.

The partial evaluation mechanism helps identify and load relevant permissions from the database by using the resource
identifiers that the realm administrator has permission to "view". These identifiers are then applied in the subsequent
database query to fetch the actual stream of resources. Partial evaluation is not supported for federated resources, which
is a limitation of the current implementation.

===== Searching Permissions

The Admin Console provides several ways to search for permissions, supporting the following capabilities:

* Search for permissions that contain a specific string in their *Name*
* Search for permissions of a specific resource type, such as *Users*
* Search for permissions of a specific resource type that apply to a particular resource (such as *Users* resource type for user `myadmin`).
* Search for permissions of a specific resource type with a given scope (such as *Users* resource type permissions with the *manage* scope).
* Search for permissions of a specific resource type that apply to a particular resource and have a specific scope (such as *Users* resource
  type permissions with the *manage* scope for user `myadmin`).

image:images/fine-grain-search.png[Fine grained permissions search]

[[_resolving-conflicting-permissions]]
===== Resolving conflicting permissions

Permissions can have multiple policies associated with them. As the authorization model evolves, it is common for some policies within a permission or
even different permissions related to a specific resource to conflict.

The evaluation outcome will be "denied" whenever any permission is evaluated to "DENY." If there are multiple permissions related to the same resource,
all of them must grant access in order for the outcome to be "granted."

IMPORTANT: Fine-grained admin permissions allow you to set up permissions for individual resources or for the resource type itself (such as all users,
all groups, and so on.). If a permission or permissions related to a specific resource exist, the "all-resource" permission is *NOT* taken into account
during evaluation. If no specific permission exists, the fallback is to the "all-resource" permission. This approach helps address scenarios like
allowing members of the `realm-admins` group to manage members of realm groups, but preventing them from managing members of the `realm-admins` group
themselves.

*View and Manage users and group members*

When evaluating *view* or *manage* permissions for users the group *view-members* and *manage-members* permissions are taken into an account.
The evaluation follows:

* Specific user/group permissions take precedence over broader all-resource permissions.
* If multiple permissions apply to a given user or group (such as multiple user-specific permissions, or a permission covering a set of
  users/groups where the user is member of), all of them are evaluated, and all of them must grant access for the outcome to be GRANTED.
* If no user/group-specific permissions exist, the evaluation falls back to all-resource permissions ("all-users", "all-groups").
* When both all-users and all-groups permissions exist, both must grant access for the outcome to be GRANTED.
* If only one of them exists, the outcome is determined by that permission alone.

[[_realm_access_control]]
==== Accessing a Realm Admin Console as a Realm Administrator

Realm administrators can access a dedicated realm-specific Admin Console, which allows them to manage resources within their assigned realm.
This is separate from the main Keycloak Admin Console, which is typically used by server administrators.

For more details on dedicated realm admin consoles and available roles, refer to: <<_per_realm_admin_permissions, Dedicated admin consoles>>.

To access the Admin Console, a realm administrator must have at least one of the following roles assigned, depending on the resources they
need to administer:

- *query-users* â€“ Required to query realm users.
- *query-groups* â€“ Required to query realm groups.
- *query-clients* â€“ Required to query realm clients.

If an administrator is responsible for multiple resource types (such as both users and groups), they must have all corresponding "query-*"
roles assigned.

These roles enable basic access to query resources but do not grant permission to view or modify them. To configure more fine-grained
administrative access, additional permissions must be granted using fine-grained admin permissions.

===== Granting Administrative Roles to a Realm Administrator

A realm administratorâ€™s access must be configured by someone with permission to assign administrative roles. At a minimum, the administrator
must have:

- The appropriate "query-*" roles, depending on the resource types they need to administer.

Beyond these foundational roles, *fine-grained admin permissions* can be used to define specific administrative capabilities. While fine-grained
permissions allow for more granular control over access, they cannot override the default behavior of built-in admin roles.
This means that if an respective admin role is assigned to a realm administrator, permission evaluation will be bypassed, and access will be
granted.

====== Roles and Permission relationship

Fine grained permissions are used to grant additional permissions. You cannot override the default behavior of the built-in admin roles.
If a realm admin is assigned one or more admin roles, it prevents the permissions from being evaluated.

[cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| *Admin Role*              | *Description*

| *query-users*            | A realm administrator can see the *Users* section in Admin Console and can search for users in the realm.
                             It does not grant the ability to *view* users.
| *query-groups*           | A realm administrator can see the *Groups* section in Admin Console and can search for groups in the realm.
                             It does not grant the ability to *view* groups.
| *query-clients*          | A realm administrator can see the *Clients* section in Admin Console and can search for clients in the realm.
                             It does not grant the ability to *view* clients.
| *view-users*             | A realm administrator can *view* all users and groups in the realm.
| *manage-users*           | A realm administrator can *view*, *map-roles*, *manage-group-membership* and *manage* all users in the realm,
                             as well as *view*, *manage-membership* and *manage* groups in the realm.
| *impersonation*          | A realm administrator can *impersonate* all users in the realm.
| *view-clients*           | A realm administrator can *view* all clients in the realm.
| *manage-clients*         | A realm administrator can *view* and *manage* all clients and client scopes in the realm.
|===

==== Understanding some common use cases

Consider a situation where an administrator wants to allow a group of administrators to manage all users in the realm except those that
belong to the administrators group. This example includes a `test` realm and a `test-admins` group.

===== Allow manage users by group of administrators

Create user permission permission, allowing to view and manage all users in the realm for members of the `test-admins` group:

* Navigate to the *Permissions* tab in the Admin Console.
* Click *Create permission* and choose *Users* resource type.
* Fill in the name, such as `Disallow managing test-admins`.
* Choose *view* and *manage* authorization scopes, keep checked *All Users*.
* Create a condition, which needs to be met to get an access by clicking *Create new policy*.
* Fill in the name `Allow test-admins`, select *Group* as *Policy type*.
* Click *Add groups* button and select `test-admins` group, click *Save*.
* Click *Save* on *Create permission* page.

===== Allow manage users by group of admins but not group members

Let's exlude the members of the group itself, so that `test-admins` cannot manage other admins.

* Create new permission by clicking *Create permission*.
* This time choose *Groups* resource type.
* Fill in the name, such as `Disallow managing test-admins`.
* Choose *manage-members* authorization scope.
* Select *Specific Groups* and choose `test-admins` group.
* *Create new policy* of type *Group*.
* Fill the name `Disallow test-admins` and select `test-admins` group.
* Switch to *Negative Logic* for the policy, *Save* the policy
* *Save* the permission

=====  Allow impersonation of users for members of admin group with specific role assigned

- Create a "User Permission" for specific users (or all users) you want to allow impersonation.
- Create a "Group Policy" allowing access to members of `test-admins`.
- Create a "Role Policy" allowing access to users assigned the `impersonation-admin` role.
- Assign both policies to the permission.

===== Blacklist specific users from being impersonated

- Create a *User Permission* for the specific users you want to prevent from being impersonated.
- Create any policy that evaluates to deny (such as a user policy with no users selected).
- Assign the policy to the permission to effectively block impersonation for the selected users.

===== Allow viewing users but not managing them for admins with defined role assigned

- Create a "User Permission" with the *view* scope for all users.
- Create a "Role Policy" allowing access to users with specific role assigned.
- Do _not_ assign the `manage` scope to prevent modification of user details.

===== Allow managing users and role assignment for members of a group

- Create a "User Permission" with the *manage*, *map-roles* scopes for all users.
- Create a "Group Policy" allowing access to members of `test-admins`.

===== Allow viewing and managing members of a group but not members of its subgroups

- Create a "Group Permission" with the *view-members* and *manage-members* scopes for specific group `mygroup`.
- Assign a "Group Policy" targeting `test-admins` to it.
- Create another "Group Permission" with the *view-members* and *manage-members* scopes for specific group, select all subgroups of the `mygroup`.
- Create negative "Group Policy" for `test-admins` and assign it to the "subgroups" permission.

===== Allow impersonating members of a specific group

- Create a "Group Permission" with the *impersonate-members* for specific group `mygroup`.
- Assign a "Group Policy" targeting `mygroup-helpdesk` to it.
