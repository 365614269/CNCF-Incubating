= Application initiated actions

Application initiated actions (AIA) allow client applications to request a user to perform an action on the {project_name} side. Usually, when an OIDC client application
wants a user to log in, it redirects that user to the login URL as described in the <<con-oidc_{context}, OIDC section>>. After login, the user is redirected back to the client application.
The user performs the actions that were required by the administrator as described in the <<proc-setting-required-actions_{context}, previous section>>
and then is immediately redirected back to the application. However, AIA allows the client application to request some required actions from the user during login. This can be
done even if the user is already authenticated on the client and has an active SSO session. It is triggered by adding the `kc_action` parameter to the OIDC login URL with the value containing the requested action.
For instance `kc_action=UPDATE_PASSWORD` parameter.

A user may cancel an application initiated action. In this case the user is redirected back to the client application.
The redirect URI will contain the query parameters `kc_action_status=cancelled` and `kc_action` with the name of the cancelled action.

NOTE: The `kc_action` and `kc_action_status` parameters are a {project_name} proprietary mechanism unsupported by the OIDC specification.

NOTE: Application initiated actions are supported only for OIDC clients.

So if AIA is used, an example flow is similar to the following:

* A client application redirects the user to the OIDC login URL with the additional parameter such as `kc_action=UPDATE_PASSWORD`

* There is a `browser` flow always triggered as described in the <<_authentication-flows, Authentication flows section>>. If the user was not authenticated, that user needs to authenticate as during normal login.
In case the user was already authenticated, that user might be automatically re-authenticated by an SSO cookie without needing to actively re-authenticate and supply the credentials again. In this case, that user will be
directly redirected to the screen with the particular action (update password in this case). However, in some cases, active re-authentication is required even if the user has an SSO
cookie (See <<con-aia-reauth_{context}, below>> for the details).

* The screen with particular action (in this case `update password`) is displayed to the user, so that user needs to perform a particular action

* Then user is redirected back to the client application

Note that AIA are used by the {project_name} <<_account-service, Account Console>> to request update password or to reset other credentials such as OTP or WebAuthn.

WARNING: Even if the parameter `kc_action` was used, it is not sufficient to assume that the user always performs the action.  For example, a user could have manually deleted
the `kc_action` parameter from the browser URL. Therefore, no guarantee exists that the user has an OTP for the account after the client requested `kc_action=CONFIGURE_TOTP`. If you
want to verify that the user configured two-factor authenticator, the client application may need to check it was configured. For instance
by checking the claims like `acr` in the tokens.

[id="con-aia-reauth_{context}"]
== Re-authentication during AIA

In case the user is already authenticated due to an active SSO session, that user usually does not need to actively re-authenticate. However, if that user actively authenticated longer than five minutes ago,
the client can  still request re-authentication when some AIA is requested. Exceptions exist from this guideline as follows:

* The action `delete_account` will always require the user to actively re-authenticate

* The action `update_password` might require the user to actively re-authenticate according to the configured <<maximum-authentication-age,Maximum Authentication Age Password policy>>.
In case the policy is not configured, it is also possible to configure it on the required action itself in the <<proc-setting-default-required-actions_{context}, Required actions tab>>
when configuring the particular required action. If the policy is not configured in any of those places, it defaults to five minutes.

* If you want to use a shorter re-authentication, you can still use a parameter query parameter such as  `max_age` with the specified shorter value or eventually `prompt=login`, which will always require user to
actively re-authenticate as described in the OIDC specification. Note that using `max_age` for a longer value than the default five minutes (or the one prescribed by password policy) is not supported.
The `max_age` can be currently used only to make the value shorter than the default five minutes.

* If <<_step-up-flow,Step-up authentication>> is enabled and the action is to add or delete a credential, authentication is required with the level corresponding
to the given credential. This requirement exists in case the user already has the credential of the particular level. For example, if `otp` and `webauthn` are configured in the authentication flow as 2nd-factor authenticators
(both in the authentication flow at level 2) and the user already has a 2nd-factor credential (`otp` or `webauthn` in this case), the user is required to authenticate with an existing 2nd-factor credential to add another 2nd-level credential.
In the same manner, deleting an existing 2nd-factor credential (`otp` or `webauthn` in this case), authentication  with an existing 2nd-factor level credential is required. The requirement exists for security reasons.

[id="con-aia-parameterized_{context}"]
== Parameterized AIA

Some AIA can require the parameter to be sent together with the action name. For instance, the `Delete Credential` action can be triggered only by AIA and it requires a parameter to be sent together with the name
of the action, which points to the ID of the removed credential. So the URL for this example would be `kc_action=delete_credential:ce1008ac-f811-427f-825a-c0b878d1c24b`. In this case, the
part after the colon character (`ce1008ac-f811-427f-825a-c0b878d1c24b`) contains the ID of the credential of the particular user, which is to be deleted. The `Delete Credential` action 
displays the confirmation screen where the user can confirm agreement to delete the credential.

NOTE: The <<_account-service,{project_name} Account Console>> typically uses the `Delete Credential` action when deleting a 2nd-factor credential.  You can check the Account Console for examples if you want
to use this action directly from your own applications. However, relying on the Account Console is best instead of managing credentials from your own applications.

[id="con-aia-available-actions_{context}"]
== Available actions

To see all available actions, log in to the Admin Console and go to the top right top corner to click `Realm info` -> tab `Provider info` -> Find provider `required-action` .
But note that this can be further restricted based on what actions are enabled for your realm in the <<proc-setting-default-required-actions_{context}, Required actions tab>>.
