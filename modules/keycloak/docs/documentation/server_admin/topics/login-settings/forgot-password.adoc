. Specify `Host` and `From` in the *Email* tab in order for {Project_Name} to be able to send the reset email.

The text sent in the email is configurable. See link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}] for more information.

When users click the email link, {project_name} asks them to update their password, and if they have set up an OTP generator, {project_name} asks them to reconfigure the OTP generator. By default, the flow maintains the user who is logged in if the same authentication session (same browser) was used. Depending on the security requirements of your organization, you may not want users to reset their OTP generator through email or you may want to force them to login again after the process.

To change this behavior, perform these steps:

.Procedure
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Flows* tab.
. Select the *Reset Credentials* flow.

If you do not want to reset the OTP, set the `Reset - Conditional OTP` sub-flow requirement to *Disabled*.

If the user needs to login again after the password change, click the *Send Reset Email* settings icon in the flow, define an *Alias*, and enable *Force login after reset*.
. Click *Authentication* in the menu.
. Click the *Required actions* tab.
. Ensure *Update Password* is enabled.
