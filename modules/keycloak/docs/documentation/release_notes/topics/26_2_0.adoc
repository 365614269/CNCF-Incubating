= Additional query parameters in Admin Events API

The Admin Events API now supports filtering for events based on Epoc timestamps in addition to the previous
`yyyy-MM-dd` format. This provides more fine-grained control of the window of events to retrieve.

A `direction` query parameter was also added, allowing controlling the order of returned items as `asc` or
`desc`. In the past the events where always returned in `desc` order (most recent events first).

Finally, the returned event representations now also include the `id`, which provides a unique identifier for
an event.

= Option to reload trust and key material for the management interface

The `https-management-certificates-reload-period` option can be set to define the reloading period of key store, trust store, and certificate files referenced by `https-management-*` options for the management interface.
Use -1 to disable reloading. Defaults to `https-certificates-reload-period`, which defaults to 1h (one hour).

For more information, check the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/management-interface#_tls_support[Configuring the Management Interface] guide.

= New cache for CRLs loaded for the X.509 authenticator

Now the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL), that are used to validate certificates in the X.509 authenticator, are cached inside a new infinispan cache called `crl`. Caching improves the validation performance and decreases the memory consumption because just one CRL is maintained per source.

Check the `crl-storage` section in the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-provider-config[All provider configuration] {section} to know the options for the new cache provider.

= Dynamic Authentication Flow selection using Client Policies

Introduced the ability to dynamically select authentication flows based on conditions such as requested scopes, ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference) and others.
This can be achieved using link:{adminguide_link}#_client_policies[Client Policies] by combining the new `AuthenticationFlowSelectorExecutor` with conditions like the new `ACRCondition`. For more details, see the link:{adminguide_link}#_client-policy-auth-flow[{adminguide_name}].

= Logs support ECS format

All available log handlers now support *ECS* (Elastic Common Schema) JSON format.
It helps to improve {project_name}'s observability story and centralized logging.

For more details, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Logging guide].

= Federated credentials are available now when fetching user credentials

Until now, querying user credentials using the User API will not return credentials managed by user storage providers and, as a consequence,
prevent fetching additional metadata associated with federated credentials like the last time a credential was updated.

In this release, we are adding a new method `getCredentials(RealmModel, UserModel)` to the `org.keycloak.credential.CredentialInputUpdater` interface so that
user storage providers can return the credentials they manage for a specific user in a realm. By doing this, user storage providers can indicate
whether the credential is linked to it as well as provide additional metadata so that additional information can be shown when managing users through the administration console.

For LDAP, it should be possible now to see the last time the password was updated based on the standard `pwdChangedTime` attribute or, if
using Microsoft AD, based on the `pwdLastSet` attribute.

In order to check if a credential is local - managed by {project_name} - or federated, you can check the `federationLink` property available from both
`CredentialRepresentation` and `CredentialModel` types. If set, the `federationLink` property holds the UUID of the component model associated with a given
user storage provider.
