= Additional query parameters in Admin Events API

The Admin Events API now supports filtering for events based on Epoc timestamps in addition to the previous
`yyyy-MM-dd` format. This provides more fine-grained control of the window of events to retrieve.

A `direction` query parameter was also added, allowing controlling the order of returned items as `asc` or
`desc`. In the past the events where always returned in `desc` order (most recent events first).

Finally, the returned event representations now also include the `id`, which provides a unique identifier for
an event.
