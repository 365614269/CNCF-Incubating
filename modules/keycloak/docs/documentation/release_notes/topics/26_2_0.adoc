= Supported Standard Token Exchange

In this release, we added support for the Standard token exchange! The token exchange feature was in preview for a long time, so we are glad to finally support the standard token exchange.
For now, this is limited to exchanging the Internal token to internal token compliant with the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693[Token exchange specification]. It does not yet cover use
cases related to identity brokering or subject impersonation. We hope to support even more token exchange use cases in subsequent releases.

For more details, see the link:{securing_apps_token_exchange_link}#_standard-token-exchange[Standard token exchange].

For information on how to upgrade from the legacy token exchange used in previous {project_name} versions, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Guides for metrics and Grafana dashboards

In addition to the list of useful metric names link:{observablitycategory_link}[the Observability guides category] now also contains a guide on how to display these metrics in Grafana.
link:{grafanadashboards_link}[The guide] contains two dashboards.

* Keycloak troubleshooting dashboard - showing metrics related to service level indicators and troubleshooting.
* Keycloak capacity planning dashboard - showing metrics related to estimating the load handled by Keycloak.

= Zero-configuration secure cluster communication

For clustering multiple nodes, {project_name} uses distributed caches.
Starting with this release for all TCP-based transport stacks, the communication between the nodes is encrypted with TLS and secured with automatically generated ephemeral keys and certificates.

This strengthens a secure-by-default setup and minimizes the configuration steps of new setups.

For more information, check the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/caching#_securing_transport_stacks[Securing Transport Stacks] in the distributed caches guide.

= Rolling updates for optimized and customized images

When using an optimized or customized image, the {project_name} Operator can now perform a rolling update for a new image if the old and the new image contain the same version of {project_name}.
This is helpful when you want to roll out, for example, an updated theme or provider without downtime.

To use the functionality in the Operator, enable the `Auto` update strategy and the {project_name} Operator will on image change briefly start up the old and the new image to determine if a rolling update without downtime is possible.
Read the section https://www.keycloak.org/operator/rolling-updates[Managing Rolling Updates] in the {project_name} Operator Advanced Configuration guide for more details on this functionality.

The checks to determine if a rolling update is possible are also available on the {project_name} command line so you can use them in your deployment pipeline. Continue reading in the https://www.keycloak.org/server/update-compatibility[Update Compatibility Tool] guide for more information about the functionality available on the command line.

= Additional query parameters in Admin Events API

The Admin Events API now supports filtering for events based on Epoc timestamps in addition to the previous
`yyyy-MM-dd` format. This provides more fine-grained control of the window of events to retrieve.

A `direction` query parameter was also added, allowing controlling the order of returned items as `asc` or
`desc`. In the past the events where always returned in `desc` order (most recent events first).

Finally, the returned event representations now also include the `id`, which provides a unique identifier for
an event.

= Logs support ECS format

All available log handlers now support *ECS* (Elastic Common Schema) JSON format.
It helps to improve {project_name}'s observability story and centralized logging.

For more details, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Logging guide].

= New cache for CRLs loaded for the X.509 authenticator

Now the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL), that are used to validate certificates in the X.509 authenticator, are cached inside a new infinispan cache called `crl`. Caching improves the validation performance and decreases the memory consumption because just one CRL is maintained per source.

Check the `crl-storage` section in the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-provider-config[All provider configuration] {section} to know the options for the new cache provider.

= Operator creates NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic

The {project_name} Operator now creates by default a NetworkPolicy to restrict traffic to internal ports used for {project_name}'s distributed caches.

This strengthens a secure-by-default setup and minimizes the configuration steps of new setups.

You can restrict the access to the management and HTTP endpoints further using the Kubernetes NetworkPolicies rule syntax.

Read more about this in the https://www.keycloak.org/operator/advanced-configuration[Operator Advanced configuration].

= Option to reload trust and key material for the management interface

The `https-management-certificates-reload-period` option can be set to define the reloading period of key store, trust store, and certificate files referenced by `https-management-*` options for the management interface.
Use -1 to disable reloading. Defaults to `https-certificates-reload-period`, which defaults to 1h (one hour).

For more information, check the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/management-interface#_tls_support[Configuring the Management Interface] guide.

= Dynamic Authentication Flow selection using Client Policies

Introduced the ability to dynamically select authentication flows based on conditions such as requested scopes, ACR (Authentication Context Class Reference) and others.
This can be achieved using link:{adminguide_link}#_client_policies[Client Policies] by combining the new `AuthenticationFlowSelectorExecutor` with conditions like the new `ACRCondition`. For more details, see the link:{adminguide_link}#_client-policy-auth-flow[{adminguide_name}].

= Federated credentials are available now when fetching user credentials

Until now, querying user credentials using the User API will not return credentials managed by user storage providers and, as a consequence,
prevent fetching additional metadata associated with federated credentials like the last time a credential was updated.

In this release, we are adding a new method `getCredentials(RealmModel, UserModel)` to the `org.keycloak.credential.CredentialInputUpdater` interface so that
user storage providers can return the credentials they manage for a specific user in a realm. By doing this, user storage providers can indicate
whether the credential is linked to it as well as provide additional metadata so that additional information can be shown when managing users through the administration console.

For LDAP, it should be possible now to see the last time the password was updated based on the standard `pwdChangedTime` attribute or, if
using Microsoft AD, based on the `pwdLastSet` attribute.

In order to check if a credential is local - managed by {project_name} - or federated, you can check the `federationLink` property available from both
`CredentialRepresentation` and `CredentialModel` types. If set, the `federationLink` property holds the UUID of the component model associated with a given
user storage provider.

= Token based authentication for SMTP (XOAUTH2)

The Keycloak outgoing link:{adminguide_email_name}[SMTP mail configuration] now supports token authentication (XOAUTH2).
Many service providers (Microsoft, Google) are moving towards SMTP OAuth authentication and end the support for basic authentication.
The token is gathered using Client Credentials Grant.

= New client configuration for access token header type

A new admin setting has been added: Clients -> Advanced -> Fine grain OpenID Connect configuration -> Use "at+jwt" as access token header type

If enabled, access tokens will get header type `at+jwt` in compliance with https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9068#section-2.1[rfc9068#section-2.1]. Otherwise, the access token header type will be `JWT`.

This setting is turned off by default.

= OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance documentation

The OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI) remains an experimental feature in {project_name}, but it received further improvements and especially the link:{adminguide_link}#_oid4vci[The documentation],
with the steps how to try this feature.

You will find significant development and discussions in the https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi[Keycloak OAuth SIG]. Anyone from the Keycloak community is welcome to join and provide the feedback.

Many thanks to all members of the OAuth SIG group for the participation in the development and discussions about this feature. Especially thanks to
https://github.com/Awambeng[Awambeng Rodrick] and https://github.com/IngridPuppet[Ingrid Kamga].
