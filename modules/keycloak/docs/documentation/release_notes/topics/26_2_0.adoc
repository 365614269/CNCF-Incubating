= Additional query parameters in Admin Events API

The Admin Events API now supports filtering for events based on Epoc timestamps in addition to the previous
`yyyy-MM-dd` format. This provides more fine-grained control of the window of events to retrieve.

A `direction` query parameter was also added, allowing controlling the order of returned items as `asc` or
`desc`. In the past the events where always returned in `desc` order (most recent events first).

Finally, the returned event representations now also include the `id`, which provides a unique identifier for
an event.

= New cache for CRLs loaded for the X.509 authenticator

Now the Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL), that are used to validate certificates in the X.509 authenticator, are cached inside a new infinispan cache called `crl`. Caching improves the validation performance and decreases the memory consumption because just one CRL is maintained per source.

Check the `crl-storage` section in the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-provider-config[All provider configuration] {section} to know the options for the new cache provider.
