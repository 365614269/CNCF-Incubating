= Java adapter deprecation and removal

Back in 2022 we announced the https://www.keycloak.org/2022/02/adapter-deprecation.html[deprecation of Keycloak adapters in Keycloak 19].
To give the community more time to adopt this https://www.keycloak.org/2023/03/adapter-deprecation-update.html[was delayed].

With that in mind this will be the last major release of Keycloak to include OpenID Connect and SAML adapters.
As Jetty 9.x has not been supported since 2022 the Jetty adapter has been removed already in this release.

The generic Authorization Client library will continue to be supported, and aims to be used in combination with any
other OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect libraries.

The only adapter we will continue to deliver is the SAML adapter for latest releases of WildFly and EAP 8.x. Reasoning
for continuing to support this is down to the fact that the majority of the SAML codebase in Keycloak was a contribution
from WildFly. As part of this contribution we agreed to maintain SAML adapters for WildFly and EAP in the long run.

== Jetty adapter removed

Jetty 9.4 has not been supported in the community for a long time, and reached end-of-life in 2022. At the same time the
adapter has not been updated or tested with more recent versions of Jetty. For these reasons the Jetty adapter has been
removed from this release.

= New Welcome Page

The 'welcome' page that is shown when a user starts Keycloak for the first time, has been redesigned to provide a better setup experience and has been upgraded to the latest version of https://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly]. The page layout has been simplified and now includes only a form to register the administrative user. After completing the registration, the user is redirected directly to the Administration Console.

If you are using a custom theme, you may need to update it to support the new welcome page. For more details consult the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Keycloak JS

== Using `exports` field in `package.json`

The Keycloak JS adapter now uses the https://webpack.js.org/guides/package-exports/[`exports` field] in its `package.json`. This change improves support for more modern bundlers like Webpack 5 and Vite, but comes with some unavoidable breaking changes. Consult the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more details.

== PKCE enabled by default

The Keycloak JS adapter now sets the `pkceMethod` option to `S256` by default. This enables Proof Key Code Exchange (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636[PKCE]) for all applications using the adapter. If you are using the adapter on a system that doesn't support PKCE, you can set the `pkceMethod` option to `false` to disable it.

= Truststore Improvements

Keycloak introduces an improved truststores configuration options. The Keycloak truststore is now used across the server: for outgoing connections, mTLS, database drivers and more. It's no longer needed to configure separate truststores for individual areas. To configure the truststore, you can put your truststores files or certificates in the default `conf/truststores`, or use the new `truststore-paths` config option. For details refer to the relevant https://www.keycloak.org/server/keycloak-truststore[guide].

= Versioned Features

Features now support versioning. For preserving backward compatibility all existing features (incl. `account2` and `account3`) are marked as version 1. Newly introduced feature will leverage the versioning allowing users to easily select between different implementations of desired features.

For details refer to the https://www.keycloak.org/server/features[features guide].

== Keycloak CR Truststores

You may also take advantage of the new server-side handling of truststores via the Keycloak CR, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  truststores:
    mystore:
      secret:
        name: mystore-secret
    myotherstore:
      secret:
        name: myotherstore-secret
----

Currently only Secrets are supported.

== Trust Kubernetes CA

The cert for the Kubernetes CA is added automatically to your {project_name} Pods managed by the Operator.

= Automatic certificate management for SAML identity providers

The SAML identity providers can now be configured to automatically download the signing certificates from the IDP entity metadata descriptor endpoint. In order to use the new feature the option `Metadata descriptor URL` should be configured in the provider (URL where the IDP metadata information with the certificates is published) and `Use metadata descriptor URL` needs to be `ON`. The certificates are automatically downloaded and cached in the `public-key-storage` SPI from that URL. The certificates can also be reloaded or imported from the admin console, using the action combo in the provider page.

See the https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#saml-v2-0-identity-providers[documentation] for more details about the new options.

= Non-blocking health check for load balancers

A new health check endpoint available at `/lb-check` was added.
The execution is running in the event loop which means this check is responsive also in overloaded situations when Keycloak needs to handle many requests waiting in request queue.
This behavior is useful, for example, in multi-site deployment where we do not want to fail over to the other site under heavy load.
The endpoint is currently checking availability of the embedded and external Infinispan caches. Other checks may be added later.


This endpoint is not available by default.
To enable it, run Keycloak with feature `multi-site`.
Proceed to https://www.keycloak.org/server/features[Enabling and disabling features] guide for more details.

= Keycloak CR Optimized Field

The Keycloak CR now includes an `startOptimized` field, which may be used to override the default assumption about whether to use the `--optimized` flag for the start command.
As a result, you can use the CR to configure build time options also when a custom Keycloak image is used.

= Enhanced reverse proxy settings

It is now possible to separately enable parsing of either `Forwarded` or `X-Forwarded-*` headers via the new `--proxy-headers` option.
For details consult the https://www.keycloak.org/server/reverseproxy[Reverse Proxy Guide].
The original `--proxy` option is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For migration instructions consult the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Breaking changes to the User Profile SPI

In this release, there are changes to the User Profile SPI that might impact existing implementations based on this SPI. For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Changes to the user representation in both Admin API and Account contexts

In this release, we are encapsulating the root user attributes (such as `username`, `email`, `firstName`, `lastName`, and `locale`) by moving them to a base/abstract class in order to align how these attributes
are marshalled and unmarshalled when using both Admin and Account REST APIs.

This strategy provides consistency in how attributes are managed by clients and makes sure they conform to the user profile
configuration set to a realm.

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Changes to Freemarker templates to allow rendering pages based on the user profile configuration set to a realm

In this release, the following templates were updated to make it possible to dynamically render attributes based
on the user profile configuration set to a realm:

* `login-update-profile.ftl`
* `register.ftl`
* `update-email.ftl`

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= The update profile page when logging in for the first time through a broker now have its own Freemarker templates

In this release, the server will render the update profile page when the user is authenticating through a broker for the
first time using the `idp-review-user-profile.ftl` template.

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Sequential loading of offline sessions and remote sessions

Starting with this release, the first member of a Keycloak cluster will load remote sessions sequentially instead of in parallel.
If offline session preloading is enabled, those will be loaded sequentially as well.

For more details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Performing actions on behalf of another user is not longer possible when the user is already authenticated

In this release, you can no longer perform actions such as email verification if the user is already authenticated
and the action is bound to another user. For instance, a user can not complete the verification email flow if the email link
is bound to a different account.

= Changes to the email verification flow

In this release, if a user tries to follow the link to verify the email and the email was previously verified, a proper message
will be shown.

In addition to that, a new error (`EMAIL_ALREADY_VERIFIED`) event will be fired to indicate an attempt to verify an already verified email. You can
use this event to track possible attempts to hijack user accounts in case the link has leaked or to alert users if they do not recognize the action.

= Deprecated offline session preloading

The default behavior of Keycloak is to load offline sessions on demand.
The old behavior to preload them at startup is now deprecated, as pre-loading them at startup doesn't scale well with a growing number of sessions, and increases Keycloak memory usage. The old behavior will be removed in a future release.

For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Infinispan metrics use labels for cache manager and cache names

When enabling metrics for {project_name}'s embedded caches, the metrics now use labels for the cache manager and the cache names.

For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Authorization Policy

In previous versions of Keycloak when the last member of a User, Group or Client policy was deleted then that policy would also be deleted. Unfortunately this could lead to an escalation of privileges if the policy was used in an aggregate policy. To avoid privilege escalation the effect policies are no longer deleted and an administrator will need to update those policies.

= Keycloak CR cache-config-file option

The Keycloak CR now allows for specifying the `cache-config-file` option via the `cache` spec `configMapFile` field, for example:

----
apiVersion: k8s.keycloak.org/v2alpha1
kind: Keycloak
metadata:
  name: example-kc
spec:
  ...
  cache:
    configMapFile:
      name: my-configmap
      key: config.xml
----

= Temporary lockout log replaced with event

There is now a new event `USER_DISABLED_BY_TEMPORARY_LOCKOUT` when a user is temporarily locked out by the brute force protector.
The log with ID `KC-SERVICES0053` has been removed as the new event offers the information in a structured form.

For more details, check the
link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Updates to cookies

Cookie handling code has been refactored and improved, including a new Cookie Provider. This provides better consistency
for cookies handled by Keycloak, and the ability to introduce configuration options around cookies if needed.

= SAML User Attribute Mapper For NameID now suggests only valid NameID formats

User Attribute Mapper For NameID allowed setting `Name ID Format` option to the following values:

- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:X509SubjectName`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:WindowsDomainQualifiedName`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:kerberos`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:entity`

However, Keycloak does not support receiving `AuthnRequest` document with one of these `NameIDPolicy`, therefore these
mappers would never be used. The supported options were updated to only include the following Name ID Formats:

- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent`
- `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:transient`
