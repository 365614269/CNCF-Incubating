= Dark mode enabled for the welcome theme

We've now enabled dark mode support for all the `keycloak` themes. This feature was previously present in the admin console, account console and login, and is now also available in the welcome page. If a user indicates their preference through an operating system setting (e.g. light or dark mode) or a user agent setting, the theme will automatically follow these preferences.

If you are using a custom theme that extends any of the `keycloak` themes and are not yet ready to support dark mode, or have styling conflicts that prevent you from implementing dark mode, you can disable support by adding the following property to your theme:

[source,properties]
----
darkMode=false
----

Alternatively, you can disable dark mode support for the built-in Keycloak themes on a per-realm basis by turning off the "Dark mode" setting under the "Theme" tab in the realm settings.

= Dedicated release cycle for the Node.js adapter and JavaScript adapter

From this release onwards, the {project_name} JavaScript adapter and {project_name} Node.js adapter will have a release cycle independent of the {project_name} server release cycle. The 26.1.0 release may be the last one
where these adapters are released together with the {project_name} server, but from now on, these adapters may be released at a different time than the {project_name} server.

= Authorization Code Binding to a DPoP Key

Support now exists for https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9449#section-10[Authorization Code Binding to a DPoP Key] including support for the DPoP with Pushed Authorization Requests.

= Option to create certificates for generated EC keys

A new option, `Generate certificate`, exists for EC-DSA and Ed-DSA key providers. When the generated key is created by a realm administrator, a
certificate might be generated for this key. The certificate information is available in the Admin Console and in the JWK representation of this key, which is available
from JWKS endpoint with the realm keys.

= Minimum ACR Value for the client

The option `Minimum ACR value` is added as a configuration option on the realm OIDC clients. This addition is an enhancement related to step-up authentication, which makes it possible
to enforce minimum ACR level when logging in to the particular client.

= LDAP users are created as enabled by default when using Microsoft Active Directory

If you are using Microsoft AD and creating users through the administrative interfaces, the user will created as enabled by default.

In previous versions, it was only possible to update the user status after setting a (non-temporary) password to the user.
This behavior was not consistent with other built-in user storages as well as not consistent with others LDAP vendors supported
by the LDAP provider.

= OpenShift v3 identity brokering removed

As OpenShift v3 reached end-of-life a while back, support for identity brokering with OpenShift v3 has been removed from Keycloak.

= New conditional authenticator `Condition - sub-flow executed`

The `Condition - sub-flow executed` is a new conditional authenticator in {project_name}. The condition checks if a previous sub-flow was executed (or not executed) successfully during the authentication flow execution. For more details, see link:{adminguide_link}#conditions-in-conditional-flows[Conditions in conditional flows].

= Defining dependencies between provider factories

When developing extensions for {project_name}, developers can now specify dependencies between provider factories classes by implementing the method `dependsOn()` in the `ProviderFactory` interface.
See the Javadoc for a detailed description.

= Admin events might include now additional details about the context when the event is fired

In this release, admin events might hold additional details about the context when the event is fired. When upgrading you should
expect the database schema being updated to add a new column `DETAILS_JSON` to the `ADMIN_EVENT_ENTITY` table.

= Individual options for category-specific log levels

It is now possible to set category-specific log levels as individual `log-level-category` options.

For more details, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging#_configuring_levels_as_individual_options[Logging guide].

= Infinispan default XML configuration location

Previous releases ignored any change  to `conf/cache-ispn.xml` if the `--cache-config-file` option was not provided.

Starting from this release, when `--cache-config-file` is not set, the default Infinispan XML configuration file is `conf/cache-ispn.xml` as this is both the expected behavior and the implied behavior given the docs of the current and previous releases.

= Virtual Threads enabled for Infinispan and JGroups thread pools

Starting from this release, {project_name} automatically enables the virtual thread pool support in both the embedded Infinispan and JGroups  when running on OpenJDK 21.
This removes the need to configure the JGroups thread pool, the need to align the JGroups thread pool with the HTTP worker thread pool, and reduces the overall memory footprint.

= Transport stack `jdbc-ping` as new default

{project_name} now uses by default its database to discover other nodes of the same cluster, which removes the need of additional network related configurations especially for cloud providers. It is also a default that will work out-of-the-box in cloud environments.

Previous versions of {project_name} used as a default UDP multicast to discover other nodes to form a cluster and to synchronize the replicated caches of {project_name}.
This required multicast to be available and to be configured correctly, which is usually not the case in cloud environments.

Starting with this version, the default changes to the `jdbc-ping` configuration which uses {project_name}'s database to discover other nodes.
As this removes the need for multicast network capabilities and UDP and no longer using dynamic ports for the TCP-based failure detection, this is a simplification and a drop-in replacement for environments which used the previous default.
To enable the previous behavior, choose the transport stack `udp` which is now deprecated.

The {project_name} Operator will continue to configure `kubernetes` as a transport stack.

See the https://www.keycloak.org/server/caching[Configuring distributed caches] guide for more information.

= Updated format of KEYCLOAK_SESSION cookie and AUTH_SESSION_ID cookie

The format of `KEYCLOAK_SESSION` cookie was slightly updated to not contain any private data in plain text. Until now, the format of the cookie was `realmName/userId/userSessionId`. Now the cookie contains user session ID, which is hashed by SHA-256 and URL encoded.


The format of `AUTH_SESSION_ID` cookie was updated to include a signature of the auth session id to ensure its integrity through signature verification. The new format is `base64(auth_session_id.auth_session_id_signature)`. With this update, the old format will no longer be accepted, meaning that old auth sessions will no longer be valid. This change has no impact on user sessions.

These changes can affect you just in case when implementing your own providers and relying on the format of internal Keycloak cookies.

= Removal of robots.txt file

The `robots.txt` file, previously included by default, is now removed. The default `robots.txt` file blocked all crawling, which prevented the `noindex`/`nofollow` directives from being followed. The desired default behaviour is for {project_name} pages to not show up in search engine results and this is accomplished by the existing `X-Robots-Tag` header, which is set to `none` by default. The value of this header can be overridden per-realm if a different behaviour is needed.

If you previously added a rule in your reverse proxy configuration for this, you can now remove it.

= Imported key providers check and passivate keys with an expired cetificate

The key providers that allow to import externally generated keys (`rsa` and `java-keystore` factories) now check the validity of the associated certificate if present. Therefore a key with a certificate that is expired cannot be imported in {project_name} anymore. If the certificate expires at runtime, the key is converted into a passive key (enabled but not active). A passive key is not used for new tokens, but it is still valid for validating previous issued tokens.

The default `generated` key providers generate a certificate valid for 10 years (the types that have or can have an associated certificate). Because of the long validity and the recommendation to rotate keys frequently, the generated providers do not perform this check.

= OpenTelemetry Tracing supported

In the previous release, the OpenTelemetry Tracing feature was preview and is *fully supported* now.
It means the `opentelemetry` feature is enabled by default.

There were made multiple improvements to the tracing capabilities in {project_name} such as:

* *Configuration via Keycloak CR* in {project_name} Operator
* *Custom spans* for:
** Incoming/outgoing HTTP requests including Identity Providers brokerage
** Database operations and connections
** LDAP requests
** Time-consuming operations (passwords hashing, persistent sessions operations, ...)

For more information, see the link:{tracingguide_link}[{tracingguide_name}] guide.

= Sign out all active sessions in admin console now effectively removes all sessions

In previous versions, clicking on *Sign out all active sessions* in the admin console resulted in the removal of regular sessions only. Offline sessions would still be displayed despite being effectively invalidated.

This has been changed. Now all sessions, regular and offline, are removed when signing out of all active sessions.
