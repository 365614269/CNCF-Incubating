= New option in X.509 authenticator to abort authentication if CRL is outdated

The X.509 authenticator has a new option `x509-cert-auth-crl-abort-if-non-updated` (*CRL abort if non updated* in the Admin Console) to abort the login if a CRL is configured to validate the certificate and the CRL is not updated in the time specified in the next update field. The new option defaults to `true` in the Admin Console. For more details about the CRL next update field, see link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5280#section-5.1.2.5[RFC5280, Section-5.1.2.5].

The value `false` is maintained for compatibility with the previous behavior. Note that existing configurations will not have the new option and will act as if this option was set to `false`, but the Admin Console will add the default value `true` on edit.
