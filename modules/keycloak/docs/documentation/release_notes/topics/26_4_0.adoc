// Release notes should contain only headline-worthy new features,
// assuming that people who migrate will read the upgrading guide anyway.

Read on to learn more about each new feature, and https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/upgrading/index.html[find additional details in the upgrading guide] if you are upgrading from a previous release of {project_name}.

= Option to force management interface to use HTTP.

There's a new option `http-management-scheme` that may be set to `http` to force the management interface to use HTTP rather than inheriting the HTTPS settings of the main interface.

= Additional context information for log messages (preview)

You can now add context information to each log message like the realm or the client that initiated the request.
This helps you to track down a warning or error message in the log to a specific caller or environment

For more details on this opt-in feature, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Logging guide].
