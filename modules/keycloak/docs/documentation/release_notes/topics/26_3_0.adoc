= Usage of remote stores for embedded caches is restricted

Previously, usage of remote stores was discouraged and the experimental feature `cache-embedded-remote-store` needed to be enabled to run in this setup.
In this release, the experimental feature was removed and usage of remote stores is restricted.
If you previously used the `cache-embedded-remote-store` feature, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for migration steps.

= Asynchronous logging

All available log handlers now support asynchronous logging capabilities.
Asynchronous logging might be useful for deployments requiring **high throughput** and **low latency** to move log operations in a separate thread.

For more details, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Logging guide].

= Client initiated linking of the user account to identity provider is based on AIA

In this release, we added Application initiated action (AIA) implementation for linking a user account to the identity provider. The custom protocol, which was previously
used for client initiated account linking is deprecated now. For more information, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Deprecated for removal the Instagram Identity Broker

It has been a while since discussions started about any activity around the Instagram Identity Broker
and any objection from the community about deprecating it for removal. For more details, see
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/37967[Deprecate for removal the Instagram social broker].

In this release, the Instagram Identity Broker is deprecated for removal and is not enabled by default.
If you are using this broker, it is recommended to use the Facebook Identity Broker instead. For more
details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Recovery Codes supported

In this release, the *Recovery Codes* two-factor authentication is promoted from preview to supported feature. For more information about the 2FA method, see the link:{adminguide_link}#_recovery-codes[Recovery Codes] chapter in the {adminguide_name}.

= New AIA action parameter `skip_if_exists` for WebAuthn register

Both WebAuthn Register actions (`webauthn-register` and `webauthn-register-passwordless`) now support a parameter `skip_if_exists` when initiated by the application (AIA). The parameter allows to skip the action if the user already has a credential of that type. For more information, see the link:{adminguide_link}#_webauthn_aia[Registering WebAuthn credentials using AIA] chapter in the {adminguide_name}.

= Experimental support for rolling updates for patch releases

In the previous release, the Keycloak Operator was enhanced to support performing rolling updates of the Keycloak image if both images contain the same version.
This is useful, for example, when switching to an optimized image, changing a theme or a provider source code.

In this release, we extended this to perform rolling update when the new image contains a future patch release from the same `major.minor` release stream.

= Brokering a OAuth v2 compliant authorization server

In this release, a new broker is available to integrate with any OAuth2 compliant Authorization Server. For more information, see the link:{adminguide_link}#_identity_broker_oauth[OAuth v2 identity providers] chapter in the {adminguide_name}.

= Trusting email verification when brokering OpenID Connect Providers

In this release, the OpenID Connect broker was updated to trust email verification from OpenID Providers based on the `email_verified` claim when
the `Trust email` setting is enabled. If this claim is set to `true`, the federated user account will have their email marked as verified depending on the value from this claim. The same is true in case the OpenID Provider returns the `email_verified` claim set to `false`, in this case the federated
user account will have their email marked as unverified.

The `email_verified` claim is a standard claim as defined by the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims[OpenID Connect Core Specification].
