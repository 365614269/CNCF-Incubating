= Usage of remote stores for embedded caches is restricted

Previously, usage of remote stores was discouraged and the experimental feature `cache-embedded-remote-store` needed to be enabled to run in this setup.
In this release, the experimental feature was removed and usage of remote stores is restricted.
If you previously used the `cache-embedded-remote-store` feature, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for migration steps.

= Asynchronous logging

All available log handlers now support asynchronous logging capabilities.
Asynchronous logging might be useful for deployments requiring **high throughput** and **low latency** to move log operations in a separate thread.

For more details, see the https://www.keycloak.org/server/logging[Logging guide].

= Client initiated linking of the user account to identity provider is based on AIA

In this release, we added Application initiated action (AIA) implementation for linking a user account to the identity provider. The custom protocol, which was previously
used for client initiated account linking is deprecated now. For more information, see the link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].

= Deprecated for removal the Instagram Identity Broker

It has been a while since discussions started about any activity around the Instagram Identity Broker
and any objection from the community about deprecating it for removal. For more details, see
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/37967[Deprecate for removal the Instagram social broker].

In this release, the Instagram Identity Broker is deprecated for removal and is not enabled by default.
If you are using this broker, it is recommended to use the Facebook Identity Broker instead. For more
details, see link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}].
