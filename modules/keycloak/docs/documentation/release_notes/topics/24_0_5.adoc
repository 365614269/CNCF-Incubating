= Security issue with PAR clients using client_secret_post based authentication

This release contains the fix of the important security issue affecting some OIDC confidential clients using PAR (Pushed authorization request). In case you use OIDC confidential clients together
with PAR and you use client authentication based on `client_id` and `client_secret` sent as parameters in the HTTP request body (method `client_secret_post` specified in the OIDC specification), it is
highly encouraged to rotate the client secrets of your clients after upgrading to this version.
