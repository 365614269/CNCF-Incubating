= Support for multiple instances of a social broker in a realm

It is now possible to have multiple instances of the same social broker in a realm.

Most of the time a realm does not need multiple instances of the same social broker. But due to the introduction
of the `organization` feature, it should be possible to link different instances of the same social broker
to different organizations.

When creating a social broker, you should now provide an `Alias` and optionally a `Display name` just like any other
broker.

= Removal of OSGi metadata

Since all of the Java adapters that used OSGi metadata have been removed we have stopped generating OSGi metadata for our jars.

= Infinispan marshalling changes to Infinispan Protostream

Marshalling is the process of converting Java objects into bytes to send them across the network between {project_name} servers.
With {project_name} 26, we changed the marshalling format from JBoss Marshalling to Infinispan Protostream.

WARNING: JBoss Marshalling and Infinispan Protostream are not compatible with each other and incorrect usage may lead to data loss.
Consequently, all caches are cleared when upgrading to this version.

Infinispan Protostream is based on https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/proto3/[Protocol Buffers] (proto 3), which has the advantage of backwards/forwards compatibility.

= Group-related events no longer fired when removing a realm

With the goal of improving the scalability of groups, they are now removed directly from the database when removing a realm.
As a consequence, group-related events like the `GroupRemovedEvent` are no longer fired when removing a realm.
