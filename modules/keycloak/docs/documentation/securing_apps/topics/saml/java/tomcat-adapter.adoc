==== Tomcat SAML adapters

WARNING: The {project_name} Tomcat SAML adapter is deprecated. We recommend that you use another client adapter if possible.

To be able to secure WAR apps deployed on Tomcat 8 or 9 you must install the Keycloak Tomcat SAML adapter into your Tomcat installation.
You then have to provide some extra configuration in each WAR you deploy to Tomcat.
