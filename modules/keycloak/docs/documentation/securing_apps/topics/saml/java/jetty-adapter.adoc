WARNING: The {project_name} Jetty SAML adapter is deprecated. We recommend that you use another client adapter if possible.

To be able to secure WAR apps deployed on Jetty you must install the {project_name} Jetty 9.4 SAML adapter into your Jetty installation. You then provide some extra configuration in each WAR you deploy to Jetty.

Use the following installation and configuration procedures.
