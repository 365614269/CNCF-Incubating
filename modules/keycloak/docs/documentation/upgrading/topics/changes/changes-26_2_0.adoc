== Breaking changes

Breaking changes are identified as requiring changes from existing users to their configurations.

=== Changes to port behaviour with the `X-Forwarded-Host` header

The `X-Forwarded-Host` header can optionally also contain the port. In previous versions when the port was omitted from the header,
{project_name} fell back to the actual request port. For example if {project_name} was listening on port 8080 and the request contained
`X-Forwarded-Host: example.com` header, the resolved URL was `+http://example.com:8080+`.

This is now changed and omitting the port results in removing it from the resolved URL. The resolved URL from the previous example
would now be `+http://example.com+`.

To mitigate that, either make your reverse proxy include the port in the `X-Forwarded-Host` header or configure it to set
the `X-Forwarded-Port` header with the desired port.

=== Changes to installing Oracle JDBC driver

The required JAR for the Oracle JDBC driver that needs to be explicitly added to the distribution has changed.
Instead of providing `ojdbc11` JAR, use `ojdbc17` JAR as stated in the https://www.keycloak.org/server/db#_installing_the_oracle_database_driver[Installing the Oracle Database driver] guide.

== Notable changes

Notable changes where an internal behavior changed to prevent common misconfigurations, fix bugs or simplify running {project_name}.

=== Zero-configuration secure cluster communication

For clustering multiple nodes, {project_name} uses distributed caches.
Starting with this release for all TCP-based transport stacks, the communication between the nodes is encrypted with TLS and secured with automatically generated ephemeral keys and certificates.

If you are not using a TCP-based transport stack, it is recommended to migrate to the `jdbc-ping` transport stack to benefit from the simplified configuration and enhanced security.

If you provided your own keystore and truststore to secure the TCP transport stack communication in previous releases, it is now recommended to migrate to the automatically generated ephemeral keys and certificates to benefit from the simplified setup.

If you are using a custom transport stack, this default behavior can be disabled by setting the option `cache-embedded-mtls-enabled` to `false`.

For more information, check the link:https://www.keycloak.org/server/caching#_securing_transport_stacks[Securing Transport Stacks] in the distributed caches guide.

=== Operator creates NetworkPolicies to restrict traffic

The {project_name} Operator now creates by default a NetworkPolicy to restrict traffic to internal ports used for {project_name}'s distributed caches.

This strengthens a secure-by-default setup and minimizes the configuration steps of new setups.
We expect this to be backwards compatible to existing deployment, so no additional steps are necessary at the time of the upgrade.
You can return to the previous behavior by disabling the creation of NetworkPolicies in the Keycloak CR.

If your deployment scripts add explicit NetworkPolicies for {project_name}, you should consider removing those and migrate to the new functionality provided in the Keycloak CR as a follow-up to the upgrade.

Read more about this in the https://www.keycloak.org/operator/advanced-configuration[Operator Advanced configuration].

=== LDAP provider now can store new users, groups, and roles in a sub-DN of the base DN

When adding new users, groups, or roles, the LDAP provider would always store them in the same base DN configured for the searches. However, in some deployments admins may want to configure a broader DN with `subtree` scope to fetch users (or groups/roles) from multiple sub-DNs, but they don't want new users (or groups/roles) to be stored in this base DN in LDAP. Instead, they would like to chose one of the sub-DNs for that.

It is now possible to control where new users, groups, or roles will be created using the new `Relative User Creation DN` config option in the LDAP provider and also in the LDAP group and role mappers. For more details, check the link:{adminguide_link}#_ldap[LDAP admin guide]
