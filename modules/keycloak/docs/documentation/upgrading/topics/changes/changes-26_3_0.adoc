== Breaking changes

Breaking changes are identified as requiring changes from existing users to their configurations.

=== Deprecated for removal the Instagram Identity Broker

In this release, the Instagram Identity Broker is deprecated for removal and is not enabled by default.
If you are using this broker, it is recommended to use the Facebook Identity Broker instead.

If you are using the Instagram Identity Broker and want to re-enable it, you can do it by enabling the `instagram-broker`
feature using the `features` server option:

```
--features=instagram-broker
```

It has been a while since discussions started about any activity around the Instagram Identity Broker
and any objection from the community about deprecating it for removal. For more details, see
https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/37967[Deprecate for removal the Instagram social broker].

=== Deprecated proprietary protocol for client initiated linking to the identity provider account

When you want the user, who is authenticated to your client application, to link his or her account to a specific identity provider, consider using the Application initiated action (AIA) based
mechanism with the action `idp_link`. The proprietary custom protocol for client initiated account linking is deprecated now and might be removed in the future versions. For more information, see the
Client initiated account link section of the link:{developerguide_link}[{developerguide_name}].

=== Deprecation of `spi-connections-infinispan-quarkus-site-name`

The option `spi-connections-infinispan-quarkus-site-name` is deprecated and no longer used for multi-site setups, and it will be removed in the future.
Use `spi-cache-embedded-default-site-name` instead in setups when running with embedded distributed caches.
See the https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-provider-config[All provider configuration] for more details on these options.

=== Removal of `jboss.site.name` and `jboss.node.name`

Both system properties have been used internally within Keycloak and have not been part of the official documentation.
{project_name} will fail to start if those are present.

Instead, use the command line option `spi-cache-embedded-default-site-name` as `jboss.site.name` replacement, and `spi-cache-embedded-default-node-name` as `jboss.node.name` replacement.
See the https://www.keycloak.org/server/all-provider-config[All provider configuration] for more details on these options.

== Notable changes

Notable changes where an internal behavior changed to prevent common misconfigurations, fix bugs or simplify running {project_name}.

=== Usage of remote stores embedded caches is restricted

The experimental feature `cache-embedded-remote-store` was removed in this release and usage of remote stores for embedded caches is now restricted.

Consider one of the following cases and recommended migration steps:

* If you are using remote stores for running {project_name} in multiple data centers especially if they do not have a direct networking connection to allow all {project_name} nodes to form a cluster, follow the link:{highavailabilityguide_link}[{highavailabilityguide_name}] for deploying a multi-site {project_name} setup.
* If you are using remote stores to keep user sessions available after a {project_name} restart, use the `peristent-user-session` feature which is enabled by default.

[WARNING]
====
* {project_name} refuses to start if the `persistent-user-session` feature is disabled and remote store is configured for any of the user session caches.

* With the feature `persistent-user-session` feature enabled, the remote store configuration is ignored and {project_name} will print a warning.
