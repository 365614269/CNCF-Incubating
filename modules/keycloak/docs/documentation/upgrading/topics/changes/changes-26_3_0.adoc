Notable changes where an internal behavior changed to prevent common misconfigurations, fix bugs or simplify running {project_name}.

=== Usage of remote stores embedded caches is restricted

The experimental feature `cache-embedded-remote-store` was removed in this release and usage of remote stores for embedded caches was restricted.
Consider the following cases and recommended migration steps.

. If you are using remote stores for running {project_name} in multiple data centers, follow link:{highavailabilityguide_link}[{highavailabilityguide_name}] for deploying {project_name}.
. If you are using remote stores to keep user sessions available after a {project_name} restart, use the `peristent-user-session` feature which is enabled by default since.

WARNING: {project_name} will refuse to start if the `persistent-user-session` feature is disabled and remote store is configured for any of the user session caches.
