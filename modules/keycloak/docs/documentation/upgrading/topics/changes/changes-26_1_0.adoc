= Infinispan default XML configuration location

Previous releases ignored any change  to `conf/cache-ispn.xml` if the `--cache-config-file` option was not provided.

Starting from this release, when `--cache-config-file` is not set, the default Infinispan XML configuration file is `conf/cache-ispn.xml` as this is both the expected behavior and the implied behavior given the docs of the current and previous releases.

= Embedded Infinispan: `work` cache must be replicated

The embedded `work` cache needs to be configured as a `replicated-cache` for cache invalidation to work as expected.

Starting from this release, {project_name} check this at startup and will fail to start if it is not configured as such.
