== Breaking changes

Breaking changes are identified as requiring changes from existing users to their configurations.

There are no breaking changes in this release to public APIs or documented behavior.

== Notable changes

Notable changes where an internal behavior changed to prevent common misconfigurations, fix bugs or simplify running {project_name}.

=== Offline access removes the associated online session if the `offline_scope` is requested in the initial exchange

Any offline session in {project_name} is created from another online session. When the `offline_access` scope is requested, the current online session is used to create the associated offline session for the client. Therefore any `offline_access` request finished, until now, with two sessions, one online and one offline.

Starting with this version, {project_name} removes the initial online session if the `offline_scope` is directly requested as the first interaction for the session. The client retrieves the offline token after the code to token exchange that is associated to the offline session, but the previous online session is removed. If the online session has been used before the `offline_scope` request, by the same or another client, the online session remains active as today. Although the new behavior makes sense because the client application is just asking for an offline token, it can affect some scenarios that rely on having the online session still active after the initial `offline_scope` token request.

=== New client scope `service_account` for `client_credentials` grant mappers

{project_name} introduces a new client scope at the realm level called `service_account` which is in charge of adding the specific claims for `client_credentials` grant (`client_id`, `clientHost` and `clientAddress`) via protocol mappers. This scope will be automatically assigned to and unassigned from the client when the `serviceAccountsEnabled` option is set or unset in the client configuration.

Previously, the three mappers (`Client Id`, `Client Host` and `Client IP Address`) where added directly to the dedicated scope when the client was configured to enable service accounts, and they were never removed.

== Deprecation notices

This lists functionality that continues to work as before in this release, but will be removed in a future major release.

=== Deprecated APIs for JavaScript Authorization client

The following APIs for the JavaScript Authorization client are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release:

- The `ready` property on the `KeycloakAuthorization` instance.
- The `init()` method on the `KeycloakAuthorization` instance.

These APIs are no longer needed as initialization is done automatically on demand when calling methods on the `KeycloakAuthorization` instance. You can safely remove any code that depends on these APIs.

=== Deprecating `getAll()` methods in `Organizations` and `OrganizationMembers` APIs

`getAll()` methods in `Organizations` and `OrganizationMembers` APIs are now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release.
Instead, use corresponding `list(first, max)` methods in `Organizations` and `OrganizationMembers` APIs.

=== Deprecated transport stacks for distributed caches

The `udp`, `jdbc-ping-udp`, `tcp`, `azure`, `ec2` and `google` transport stacks have been deprecated.
Users should use the TCP based `jdbc-ping` stack as a direct replacement.
