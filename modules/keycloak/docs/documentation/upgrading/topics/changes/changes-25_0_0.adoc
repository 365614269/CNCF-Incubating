= Metrics for embedded caches enabled by default

Metrics for the embedded caches are now enabled by default.
To enable histograms for latencies, set the option `cache-metrics-histograms-enabled` to `true`.

= Metrics for HTTP endpoints enabled by default

The metrics provided by {project_name} now include HTTP server metrics starting with `http_server`.
See below for some examples.

[source]
----
http_server_active_requests 1.0
http_server_requests_seconds_count{method="GET",outcome="SUCCESS",status="200",uri="/realms/{realm}/protocol/{protocol}/auth"} 1.0
http_server_requests_seconds_sum{method="GET",outcome="SUCCESS",status="200",uri="/realms/{realm}/protocol/{protocol}/auth"} 0.048717142
----

Use the new options `http-metrics-histograms-enabled` and `http-metrics-slos` to enable default histogram buckets or specific buckets for service level objectives (SLOs).
Read more about histograms in the https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram[Prometheus documentation about histograms] on how to use the additional metrics series provided in `http_server_requests_seconds_bucket`.

= Nonce claim is only added to the ID token

The nonce claim is now only added to the ID token strictly following the OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specification. As indicated in the specification, the claim is compulsory inside the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#IDToken[ID token] when the same parameter was sent in the authorization request. The specification also recommends to not add the `nonce` after a https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#RefreshTokenResponse[refresh request]. Previously, the claim was set to all the tokens (Access, Refresh and ID) in all the responses (refresh included).

A new `Nonce backwards compatible` mapper is also included in the software that can be assigned to client scopes to revert to the old behavior. For example, the JS adapter checked the returned `nonce` claim in all the tokens before fixing issue https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues/26651[#26651] in version 24.0.0. Therefore, if an old version of the JS adapter is used, the mapper should be added to the required clients by using client scopes.

= Limiting memory usage when consuming HTTP responses

In some scenarios like brokering Keycloak uses HTTP to talk to external servers.
To avoid a denial of service when those providers send too much data, {project_name} now restricts responses to 10 MB by default.

Users can configure this limit by setting the provider configuration option `spi-connections-http-client-default-max-consumed-response-size`:

.Restricting the consumed responses to 1 MB

= Hostname Verification Policy

The default for `spi-truststore-file-hostname-verification-policy` and the new `tls-hostname-verifier` option is now DEFAULT, rather than WILDCARD. The WILDCARD and STRICT option values have been deprecated - you should simply rely upon DEFAULT instead. 

Behavior supported by WILDCARD, that is not supported by DEFAULT:
* allows wildcards in subdomain names (e.g. *.foo.com) to match anything, including multiple levels (e.g. a.b.foo.com). 
* allows matching against well known public suffixes - e.g. foo.co.gl may match *.co.gl

Behavior supported by STRICT, that is not supported by DEFAULT:
* STRICT uses a small exclusion list for 2 or 3 letter domain names ending in a 2 letter top level (*.XXX.YY) when determining if a wildcard matches. Instead DEFAULT uses a more complete list of public suffix rules and exclusions from https://publicsuffix.org/list/

It is not expected that you should be relying upon these behaviors from the WILDCARD or STRICT options.

= Removed a model module

The module `org.keycloak:keycloak-model-legacy` module was deprecated in a previous release and is removed in this release. Use the `org.keycloak:keycloak-model-storage` module instead.

= XA Transaction Changes

* The option `transaction-xa-enabled` will default to false, rather than true. If you want XA transaction support you will now need to explicitly set this option to true.
* XA Transaction recovery support is enabled by default if `transaction-xa-enabled` is true. Transaction logs will be stored at KEYCLOAK_HOME/data/transaction-logs.

= Removed offline session preloading

The old behavior to preload offline sessions at startup is now removed after it has been deprecated in the previous release.

= kcadm Changes

How kcadm parses and handles options and parameters has changed. Error messages from usage errors, the wrong option or parameter, may be slightly different than previous versions. Also usage errors will have an exit code of 2 instead of 1.

= Removing custom user attribute indexes

When searching for users by user attribute, Keycloak no longer searches for user attribute names forcing lower case comparisons. This means Keycloak's native index on the user attribute table will now be used when searching. If you have created your own index based on `lower(name)`to speed up searches, you can now remove it.

= New default client scope `basic`

The new client scope named `basic` is added as a realm "default" client scope and hence will be added to all newly created clients. The client scope is also automatically added to all existing clients during migration.

This scope contains preconfigured protocol mappers for the following claims:

 * `auth_time`

This provides additional help to reduce the number of claims in a lightweight access token, but also gives the chance to configure claims that were always added automatically.

= Removed `session_state` claim

The `session_state` claim, which contains the same value as the `sid` claim, is now removed from all tokens as it is not required according to the OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout and OpenID Connect Back-Channel Logout specifications. The `session_state` claim remains present in the Access Token Response in accordance with OpenID Connect Session Management specification.

Note that the `setSessionState()` method is also removed from the `IDToken` class in favor of the `setSessionId()` method, and the `getSessionState()` method is now deprecated.

A new `Session State (session_state)` mapper is also included and can be assigned to client scopes (for instance `basic` client scope) to revert to the old behavior.

If an old version of the JS adapter is used, the `Session State (session_state)` mapper should also be used via client scopes as described above.

= Default `http-pool-max-threads` reduced

`http-pool-max-threads` if left unset will default to the greater of 50 or 4 x (available processors). Previously it defaulted to the greater of 200 or 8 x (available processors). Reducing the number or task threads for most usage scenarios will result in slightly higher performance due to less context switching among active threads.

= Management port for metrics and health endpoints

The `/health` and `/metrics` endpoints are accessible on the management port `9000`, which is turned on by default.
That means these endpoints are no longer exposed to the standard Keycloak ports `8080` and `8443`.

In order to reflect the old behavior, use the property `--legacy-observability-interface=true`, which will not expose these endpoints on the management port.
However, this property is deprecated and will be removed in future releases, so it is recommended not to use it.

The management interface uses a different HTTP server than the default {project_name} HTTP server, and it is possible to configure them separately.
Beware, if no values are supplied for the management interface properties, they are inherited from the default {project_name} HTTP server.
