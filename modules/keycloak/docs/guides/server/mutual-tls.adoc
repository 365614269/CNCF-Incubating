title="Configuring trusted certificates for mTLS"
summary="Learn how to configure Mutual TLS to verify clients that are connecting to {project_name}."
includedOptions="https-trust-store-* https-client-auth https-management-client-auth">

In order to properly validate client certificates and enable certain authentication methods like two-way TLS or mTLS, you can set
a trust store with all the certificates (and certificate chain) the server should be trusting. There are number of capabilities that rely
on this trust store to properly authenticate clients using certificates such as Mutual TLS and X.509 Authentication.

== Enabling mTLS

Authentication using mTLS is disabled by default. To enable mTLS certificate handling when {project_name} is the server and needs to validate
certificates from requests made to {project_name} endpoints, put the appropriate certificates in a truststore and use the following
command to enable mTLS:

<@kc.start parameters="--https-client-auth=<none|request|required>"/>

Using the value `required` sets up {project_name} to always ask for certificates and fail if no certificate is provided in a request. By setting
the value to `request`, {project_name} will also accept requests without a certificate and only validate the correctness of a certificate if it exists.

WARNING: The mTLS configuration and the truststore is shared by all Realms. It is not possible to configure different truststores for different Realms.

NOTE: Management interface properties are inherited from the main HTTP server, including mTLS settings.
It means when mTLS is set, it is also enabled for the management interface.
To override the behavior, use the `https-management-client-auth` property.

== Using a dedicated truststore for mTLS

By default, {project_name} uses the System Truststore to validate certificates. See <@links.server id="keycloak-truststore"/> for details.

If you need to use a dedicated truststore for mTLS, you can configure the location of this truststore by running the following command:
<@kc.start parameters="--https-trust-store-file=/path/to/file --https-trust-store-password=<value>"/>

=== Using mTLS for outgoing HTTP requests

Be aware that this is the basic certificate configuration for mTLS use cases where {project_name} acts as server. When {project_name} acts as client
instead, e.g. when {project_name} tries to get a token from a token endpoint of a brokered identity provider that is secured by mTLS, you need to set up
the HttpClient to provide the right certificates in the keystore for the outgoing request. To configure mTLS in these scenarios, see <@links.server id="outgoinghttp"/>.

=== Configuring X.509 Authentication
