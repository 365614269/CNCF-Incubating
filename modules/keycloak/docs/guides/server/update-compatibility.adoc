The goal of this tool is to assist with modifying a {project_name} deployment, whether upgrading to a new version, enabling/disabling features, or changing configuration.
The outcome will indicate whether a rolling upgrade is possible or if a recreate upgrade is required.

This has been designed to be fully scriptable, so an update procedure can adapt to a rolling or recreate strategy depending on the configuration or version change.
It is also GitOps friendly as it allows storing the metadata of a currently running configuration in a file. This file can be used in a CI/CD run with the new configuration to determine if a rolling upgrade is possible or if a recreate upgrade is needed.

[NOTE]
====
.Rolling Upgrade
In the context of this guide, a rolling upgrade is an upgrade that can be performed with zero downtime for your deployment.
Your {project_name} nodes must be updated one by one; in other words, shut down one of your old deployment nodes and start a new deployment node.
Wait until the new node's start-up probe returns success before proceeding to the next {project_name} node. See {section} <@links.observability id="health"/> for details on how to enable and use the start-up probe.
====

[NOTE]
====
.Recreate Upgrade
A recreate upgrade is not compatible with zero-downtime and requires downtime to be applied.
Shut down all nodes of the cluster running the old version before starting the nodes with the new version.
====

The update compatibility tool involves two steps:

1. Generating the required metadata.
2. Checking the metadata to determine the possible upgrade type.

[WARNING]
====
This command is under development. At the moment, it takes into consideration only the version of {project_name} and the embedded Infinispan to determine if a rolling update is possible.
If those are unchanged, it reports that a rolling update is possible.

The current version does not yet verify configuration changes and assumes all configuration changes are eligible for a rolling update.
The same applies to changes to custom extensions and themes.

A good use case when to use this is, for example, when you want to do a rolling update when you change the {project_name} theme or your custom extensions, and only want run recreate update when the version of {project_name} changes which does not yet allow a rolling update.

While consumers of these commands should be aware of the limitations that exist today, they should not rely on the internal behavior or the structure of the metadata file as this is about to be enhanced in future versions.
Instead, they should rely only on the exit code of the `check` command to benefit from future enhancements on the internal logic to determine when a rolling update is possible.
====

== Generating the Metadata

To generate the metadata, execute the following command using the same {project_name} version and configuration options:

.Generate and save the metadata from the current deployment.
<@kc.updatecompatibility parameters="metadata --file=/path/to/file.json"/>

This command accepts all options used by the `start` command.
The metadata, in JSON format, is displayed in the console for debugging purposes.
The `--file` parameter allows you to save the metadata to a file.
This file is then used by the subsequent `check` command.

[WARNING]
====
Ensure that all configuration options, whether set via environment variables or CLI arguments, are included when running the above command.

Omitting any configuration options will result in incomplete metadata.
====

== Checking the Metadata

This command checks the metadata generated by the previous command and compares it with the current configuration and {project_name} version.
If you are upgrading to a new {project_name} version, this command must be executed with the new version.

.Check the metadata from a previous deployment.
<@kc.updatecompatibility parameters="check --file=/path/to/file.json"/>

[WARNING]
====
* Ensure that all configuration options, whether set via environment variables or CLI arguments, are included when running this command.

* Verify that the correct {project_name} version is used.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in an incorrect outcome.
====

The command will print the result to the console.
For example, if a rolling upgrade is possible, it will display:

.Rolling Upgrade possible message
[source,bash]
----
[OK] Rolling Upgrade is available.
----

Otherwise, the command will indicate that a rolling upgrade is not possible and, optionally, provide details about the incompatibility:

.Rolling Upgrade not possible message
[source,bash]
----
[Versions] Rolling Upgrade is not available. 'infinispan' is incompatible: Old=15.0.0.Final, New=15.0.11.Final #<1>
----
<1> In this example, the Infinispan version `15.0.0.Final` is not compatible with version `15.0.11.Final` and a rolling upgrade is not possible.

*Command exit code*

To aid in the development of your automation and/or DevOps pipelines, the command's exit code can be used to determine the upgrade type:

|===
|Exit Code |Description

m|0
|Rolling Upgrade is possible.

m|1
|Unexpected error occurred (e.g., the metadata file is missing or corrupted).

m|2
|Invalid CLI option.

m|3
|Rolling Upgrade is not possible.
The deployment must be shut down before applying the new configuration.
