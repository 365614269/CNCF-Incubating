Event metrics can provide admins an overview of the different activities in a {project_name} instance.
For now, only metrics for user events are captured.
For example, you can monitor the number of logins, login failures, or token refreshes performed.

The metrics are exposed using the standard metrics endpoint, and you can use it in your own metrics collection system to create dashboards and alerts.

The metrics are reported as counters per {project_name} instance.
The counters are reset on the restart of the instance.
If you have multiple instances running in a cluster, you will need to collect the metrics from all instances and aggregate them to get per a cluster view.

== Enable event metrics

To start collecting metrics, enable the feature `user-event-metrics`, enable metrics, and enable the metrics for user events.

The following shows the required startup parameters:

<@kc.start parameters="--features=user-event-metrics --metrics-enabled=true --event-metrics-user-enabled=true ..."/>

By default, there is a separate metric for each realm.
To break down the metric by client and identity provider, you can add those metrics dimension using the configuration option `event-metrics-user-tags`.
This can be useful on installations with a small number of clients and IDPs.
This is not recommended for installations with a large number of clients or IDPs as it will increase the memory usage of {project_name} and as it will increase the load on your monitoring system.

The following shows how to configure {project_name} to break down the metrics by all three metrics dimensions:

<@kc.start parameters="... --event-metrics-user-tags=realm,idp,clientId ..."/>

You can limit the events for which {project_name} will expose metrics.
See the {adminguide_link}#event-types[{adminguide_name} on event types] for an overview of the available events.

The following example limits the events collected to `LOGIN` and `LOGOUT` events:

<@kc.start parameters="... --event-metrics-user-events=login,logout ..."/>

All error events will be collected with the primary event type and will have the `error` tag filled with the error code.

The snippet below is an example of a response provided by the metric endpoint:
