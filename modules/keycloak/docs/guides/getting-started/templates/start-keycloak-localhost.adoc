== Start {project_name}

. From a terminal, open the `{archivebasename}-{version}` directory.
. Enter the following command:
<@profile.ifProduct> 
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
bin/kc.sh start-dev
----
</@profile.ifProduct>

<@profile.ifCommunity>
* On Linux, run:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
bin/kc.sh start-dev
----

* On Windows, run:
+
[source,bash,subs="attributes+"]
----
bin\kc.bat start-dev
----
</@profile.ifCommunity>

Using the `start-dev` option, you are starting {project_name} development mode. In this mode, you can try out {project_name} for the first time to get it up and running quickly. This mode offers convenient defaults for developers, such as for developing a new {project_name} theme.
