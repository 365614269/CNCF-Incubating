The number of JGroup threads is `200` by default.
While it can be configured using the property Java system property `jgroups.thread_pool.max_threads`, we advise keeping it at this value.
As shown in experiments, the total number of Quarkus worker threads in the cluster should not exceed the number of threads in the JGroup thread pool of `200` in each node to avoid requests being dropped in the JGroups communication.
Given a {project_name} cluster with four nodes, each node should then have around 50 Quarkus worker threads.
Use the {project_name} configuration option `http-pool-max-threads` to configure the maximum number of Quarkus worker threads.
