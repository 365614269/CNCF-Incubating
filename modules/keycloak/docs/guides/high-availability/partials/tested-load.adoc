== Tested load

We regularly test {project_name} with the following load:
</@profile.ifCommunity>

* 100,000 users
* 300 requests per second

<@profile.ifCommunity>
While we did not see a hard limit in our tests with these values, we ask you to test for higher volumes with horizontally and vertically scaled {project_name} name instances and databases.
