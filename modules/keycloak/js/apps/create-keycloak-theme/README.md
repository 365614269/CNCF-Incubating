npm create keycloak-theme <name> [options]
```

### Options

* `-t, --type <name>` the type of ui to be created either account or admin (currently only account is supported)

This will create a new project called `my-project` with an account ui based on the template from the quickstarts repo.

Then open the ui in a browser:

```bash
open http://localhost:8080
```
