This is the primary repository for
the Keptn software and documentation.
Keptn provides a “cloud-native” approach
for managing the application release lifecycle
metrics, observability, health checks,
with pre- and post-deployment evaluations and tasks.
It is an incubating project, under the umbrella of the
[Keptn Application Lifecycle working group](https://github.com/keptn/wg-app-lifecycle).

> **Note** Keptn was developed under the code name of
  "Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit" or "KLT" for short.
  The source code contains many vestiges of these names.

## Goals

Keptn provides Cloud Native teams with the following capabilities:

- Pre-requisite evaluation before deploying workloads and applications
- Finding out when an application (not just a workload) is ready and working
- Checking the Application Health in a declarative (cloud-native) way
- Standardized way to run pre- and post-deployment tasks
- Provide out-of-the-box Observability of the deployment cycle

![Operator Maturity Model with third level circled in](./assets/operator-maturity.jpg)

Keptn can be seen as a general purpose and declarative
[Level 3 operator](https://operatorframework.io/operator-capabilities/)
for your Application.
For this reason, Keptn is agnostic to deployment tools
that are used and works with any GitOps solution.

## Status

Status of the different features:

- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen)
  Observability: expose [OTel](https://opentelemetry.io/) metrics and traces of your deployment.
- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-yellow)
  K8s Custom Metrics: expose your Observability platform via the [Custom Metric API](https://github.com/kubernetes/design-proposals-archive/blob/main/instrumentation/custom-metrics-api.md).
- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta-yellow)
  Release lifecycle: handle pre- and post-checks of your Application deployment.
- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-stable-brightgreen)
  Certificate Manager: automatically configure TLS certificates with the
  [Keptn Certificate Manager](https://lifecycle.keptn.sh/docs/concepts/architecture/cert-manager/).
  You can instead
  [configure your own certificate manager](https://lifecycle.keptn.sh/docs/install/cert-manager/) to provide
  [secure communication with the Kube API](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/controlling-access/#transport-security).

## Installation

Keptn can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster
running Kubernetes >=1.24.

For users running [vCluster](https://www.vcluster.com/),
please note that you may need to modify
your configuration before installing Keptn; see
[Running Keptn with vCluster](https://main.lifecycle.keptn.sh/docs/install/install//#running-keptn-with-vcluster)
for more information.

Use the following command sequence
to install the latest release of Keptn:

```shell
helm repo add keptn https://charts.lifecycle.keptn.sh
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install keptn keptn/keptn -n keptn-system --create-namespace --wait
```

### Installation with only certain namespaces allowed

Keptn lifecycle orchestration is by default enabled for all namespaces except the following ones:

- `kube-system`
- `kube-public`
- `kube-node-lease`
- `cert-manager`
- `keptn-system`
- `observability`
- `monitoring`
- `<Keptn installation namespace>`

To restrict Keptn lifecycle orchestration to specific namespaces, you must specify
those namespaces during installation via helm values.
First you need to create a `values.yaml`
file

```yaml
lifecycleOperator:
  allowedNamespaces:
  - allowed-ns-1
  - allowed-ns-2
```

and add the values file to the helm installation command:

```shell
helm repo add keptn https://charts.lifecycle.keptn.sh
helm repo update
helm upgrade --install keptn keptn/keptn -n keptn-system --values values.yaml --create-namespace --wait
```

> **Note**
Please be aware that you still need to correctly annotate the namespaces where
Keptn lifecycle orchestration is allowed.
> To annotate them, use:

```shell
kubectl annotate ns <your-allowed-namespace> keptn.sh/lifecycle-toolkit='enabled'
```

> **Note**
Please be aware that, if this option is set, adding any additional namespace
requires the helm installation to be updated by adding the name of the new namespace to the list.

### Webhook

Annotating a namespace subjects it to the effects of the mutating webhook:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: podtato-kubectl
  annotations:
    keptn.sh/lifecycle-toolkit: "enabled"  # this line tells the webhook to handle the namespace
```

The mutating webhook only modifies specifically annotated resources in the annotated namespace.
When the webhook receives a request for a new pod,
it looks for the workload annotations:

```yaml
keptn.sh/workload: "some-workload-name"
```

The mutation consists in changing the scheduler used for the deployment
with the Keptn Scheduler.
The webhook then creates a workload and app resource per annotated resource.
You can also specify a custom app definition with the annotation:

```yaml
keptn.sh/app: "your-app-name"
```

In this case the webhook does not generate an app,
but it expects that the user will provide one.
Additionally, it computes a version string,
using a hash function that takes certain properties of the pod as parameters
(e.g. the images of its containers).
Next, it looks for an existing instance of a `Workload CRD`
for the specified workload name:

- If it finds the `Workload`,
  it updates its version according to the previously computed version string.
  In addition, it includes a reference to the ReplicaSet UID of the pod
  (i.e. the Pods owner),
  or the pod itself, if it does not have an owner.
- If it does not find a workload instance,
  it creates one containing the previously computed version string.
  In addition, it includes a reference to the ReplicaSet UID of the pod
  (i.e. the Pods owner), or the pod itself, if it does not have an owner.

It uses the following annotations for the specification
of the pre/post deployment checks that should be executed for the `Workload`:

- `keptn.sh/pre-deployment-tasks: task1,task2`
- `keptn.sh/post-deployment-tasks: task1,task2`

and for the Evaluations:

- `keptn.sh/pre-deployment-evaluations: my-evaluation-definition`
- `keptn.sh/post-deployment-evaluations: my-eval-definition`

After either one of those actions has been taken,
the webhook sets the scheduler of the pod
and allows the pod to be scheduled.

### Scheduler

After the Webhook mutation, the Keptn-Scheduler handles the annotated resources.
The scheduling flow follows the default
[scheduler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/kube-scheduler/)
behavior,
since it implements a scheduler plugin based on the
[scheduling framework]( https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/scheduling-framework/).
For each pod, at the very end of the scheduling cycle,
the plugin verifies that the pre deployment checks have terminated
by retrieving the current status of the WorkloadInstance.
Only when that is successful is the pod bound to a node.
