# KeptnApp

A `KeptnApp` resource is auto-generated to list all the
[workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)
that constitute a logical Keptn application
and to work with the corresponding
[KeptnAppContext](appcontext.md) resource.

## Synopsis

```yaml
apiVersion: lifecycle.keptn.sh/v1beta1
kind: KeptnApp
metadata:
  name: <app-name>
  namespace: <application-namespace>
  labels:
     app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: keptn
spec:
  version: "x.y"
  revision: x
  workloads:
  - name: <workload1-name>
    version: <version-string>
  - name: <workload2-name>
    version: <version-string>
```

## Fields
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 -->

The first set of fields are created automatically
when the app discovery feature generates the `KeptnApp` resource:

- **apiVersion** -- API version being used.
- **kind** -- Resource type.
   Must be set to `KeptnApp`

- **metadata**
     - **name** -- Unique name of this application.
       Names must comply with the
       [Kubernetes Object Names and IDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names)
       specification.
       This value is the `name` assigned to the
      `keptn.sh/app` or `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`
       label or annotation for the workloads included in this `KeptnApp`.
       If a `KeptnAppContext` resource is associated with this resource,
       it must have the same `name` as this `KeptnApp`.
     - **namespace** -- Namespace of this application.
       If a `KeptnAppContext` resource is associated with this resource,
       it must have the same `namespace` as this `KeptnApp`.
     - **labels**
          - **app-kubernetes.io/managed-by: keptn** --
            Tells Keptn that this resource was autogenerated,
            which is always the case for the `v1beta1` version.
- **spec**
     - **version** (required) -- version of the Keptn application.
     - **revision** -- revision of a `version`.
       The value is an integer that can be modified
       to trigger another deployment of a `KeptnApp` of the same version.
       For example, increment this number to restart a `KeptnApp` version
       that failed to deploy, perhaps because a
       `preDeploymentEvaluation` or `preDeploymentTask` failed.
       See
       [Restart an Application Deployment](../../guides/restart-application-deployment.md)
       for a longer discussion of this.
     - **workloads**
          - **name** (required) -- name of this Kubernetes
            [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/).
            Each [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)
            associated with this Keptn application has one entry.
          - **version** (required) -- version number for this
            [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/).
            Changing this number causes a new execution
            of checks for this
            [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) only,
            not the entire application.

## Usage

Kubernetes defines
[workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)
but does not define applications.
Keptn adds the concept of applications
defined as a set of workloads that can be executed.
A `KeptnApp` resource is added
into the repository of the deployment engine
(ArgoCD, Flux, etc.)
and is then deployed by that deployment engine.

A `KeptnApp` resource is created automatically, using the
[automatic application discovery](../../guides/auto-app-discovery.md)
feature to generate a `KeptnApp` resource
based on the
[basic annotations](../../guides/integrate.md#basic-annotations)
that are applied to any of the workload resources.
This allows you to use the Keptn observability features for existing resources
without manually populating any Keptn related resources.

The release lifecycle management feature
allows you to define pre- and post-deployment
evaluations and tasks to be run for the `KeptnApp` as a whole.
These must be added to the `KeptnApp` manifest manually.
Note that all evaluations or tasks for a specific stage
(such as `preDeploymentTasks`)
are executed in parallel.
If you have a series of tasks that should be executed sequentially,
you can code them all into a single `KeptnTaskDefinition`.

## Example

This shows an example `v1beta1` `KeptnApp` resource
with the corresponding
[KeptnAppContext](appcontext.md)
resource.

```yaml
{% include "../../migrate/keptnapp/assets/keptnapp-migrated.yaml" %}
```

## Differences between versions

The synopsis of the `KeptnApp` resource
is changed in the `v1beta1` API version:

- The `apiVersion` field now references the `v1beta1` version
  of the `lifecycle.keptn.sh` API.
- `KeptnApp` is
  [autogenerated](../../guides/auto-app-discovery.md);
  you cannot create it manually by applying a manifest.
- The `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: keptn` label or annotation
  is always used for the `v1beta1` library
  because the `KeptnApp` resource is always autogenerated.
  In earlier releases, this label was not included in `KeptnApp` resources
  that were created by applying a manifest
  that had been created manually.
- If you want to use a `KeptnAppContext` resource with your application,
  the `name` and `namespace` fields
  are taken from the annotations of the deployed Kubernetes workloads.
  The corresponding `KeptnAppContext` resource (if any),
  must have identical values for these fields.
- The `metadata.version` field is now completely managed by Keptn.
  You do not increment this value to cause
  a new execution of tasks and evaluations;
  the only way to trigger a new execution is to increment
  the `spec.version` field for the `KeptnApp` resource.
- The pre/post-deployment tasks and evaluations are now defined in the
  [KeptnAppContext](appcontext.md)
  resource rather than in the `KeptnApp` resource.

`KeptnApp` resources that were completely autogenerated
for earlier versions are automatically converted to the new structure.
You must manually migrate older `KeptnApp` resources
that were created manually
or that were manually edited
to add pre/post-deployment tasks and evaluations.
For more information please refer
to the [migration section](../../migrate/keptnapp/index.md).
