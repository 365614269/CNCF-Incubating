# KeptnAppContext

The `KeptnAppContext` custom resource works with the corresponding
[KeptnApp](app.md) resource
that has the same name and is located in the same namespace.
It allows you to

- Add metadata and links to traces for a specific application.
  This enables you to enrich your traces with additional information that
  you can use to understand and analyze
  the performance of your applications.

- Define tasks and evaluations that run
  before or after the deployment of the `KeptnApp`.

## Synopsis

```yaml
apiVersion: lifecycle.keptn.sh/v1beta1
kind: KeptnAppContext
metadata:
  name: <app-name>
  namespace: <app-namespace>
spec:
  metadata:
    <custom-attributes>
  spanLinks:
  - "<list of links>"
  preDeploymentTasks:
  - <list of tasks>
  postDeploymentTasks:
  - <list of tasks>
  preDeploymentEvaluations:
  - <list of evaluations>
  postDeploymentEvaluations:
  - <list of evaluations>
```

## Fields
<!-- markdownlint-disable MD007 -->

- **apiVersion** -- API version being used
   Must be set to `lifecycle.keptn.sh/v1beta1`
- **kind** -- Resource type
   Must be set to `KeptnAppContext`

- **metadata**
     - **name** -- Unique name of this `KeptnAppContext` resource.
       Names must comply with the
       [Kubernetes Object Names and IDs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#dns-subdomain-names)
       specification
       and match the `name` given to the associated `KeptnApp` resource.
     - **namespace** -- Namespace of this application.
       This must match the `namespace` given to
       the associated `KeptnApp` resource.
- **spec**
     - **metadata** -- list of key-value pairs
       that are propagated to the application trace as attributes.
       For example, the following lines add the `commit-id`
       and `author` information to the `KEPTN_CONTEXT`
       of the workload or `KeptnApp` where it is specified:

          ```yaml
          spec:
            metadata:
              commit-id: "1234"
              author: "myUser"
          ```

       For more information, see
       [Context metadata](../../guides/metadata.md).

     - **spanLinks** -- List of OpenTelemetry span links
       that connect multiple traces.
       For example, this can be used to connect
       deployments of the same application
       through different stages.
       You can retrieve the value to use
       from the JSON representation of the trace in Jaeger.
       The structure of this is:

          ```yaml
          00-<trace-id>-<span-id>-01
          ```

          After you add this field to your `KeptnAppContext` manifest,
          you must increment the `revision` number
          of the corresponding `KeptnApp` resource
          and apply the manifest to store the information in the traces.

          For more information, see
          [Advanced tracing configurations in Keptn Linking traces](../../guides/otel.md#advanced-tracing-configurations-in-keptn-linking-traces)

The remaining fields are required only when implementing
the release lifecycle management feature.
If used, these fields must be populated manually:

- **spec**

     - **preDeploymentTasks** -- list each task
       to be run as part of the pre-deployment stage.
       Task names must match the value of the `metadata.name` field
       for the associated [KeptnTaskDefinition](taskdefinition.md) resource.
     - **postDeploymentTasks** -- list each task
       to be run as part of the post-deployment stage.
       Task names must match the value of the `metadata.name` field
       for the associated
       [KeptnTaskDefinition](taskdefinition.md)
       resource.
     - **preDeploymentEvaluations** -- list each evaluation to be run
       as part of the pre-deployment stage.
       Evaluation names must match the value of the `metadata.name` field
       for the associated
       [KeptnEvaluationDefinition](evaluationdefinition.md)
       resource.
     - **postDeploymentEvaluations** -- list each evaluation to be run
       as part of the post-deployment stage.
       Evaluation names must match the value of the `metadata.name` field
       for the associated [KeptnEvaluationDefinition](evaluationdefinition.md)
       resource.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD007 -->

## Usage

`KeptnAppContext` lists the tasks and evaluations
to be executed pre/post-deployment.
Tasks referenced by `KeptnAppContext` are defined in a
[KeptnTaskDefinition](taskdefinition.md)
resource.
`KeptnAppContext` identifies each task
by the value of the `metadata.name` field
and does not need to understand what runner is used to define the task.
Similarly, evaluations referenced are defined in a
[KeptnEvaluationDefinition](evaluationdefinition.md)
resource and identified by the value of the `metadata.name` field;
`KeptnAppContext` does not need to understand
the data source or query being used for the evaluation.

## Example

```yaml
apiVersion: lifecycle.keptn.sh/v1beta1
kind: KeptnAppContext
metadata:
  name: podtato-head
  namespace: podtato-kubectl
spec:
  preDeploymentTasks:
    - container-sleep
    - python-secret
```

## Differences between versions

The `KeptnAppContext` resource is new in the `v1beta1` version
of the lifecycle operator.
