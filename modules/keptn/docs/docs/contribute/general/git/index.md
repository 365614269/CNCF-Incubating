# Working with Git

Keptn source for software and documentation is stored in the
[Keptn lifecycle-toolkit repository](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit).
Contributions are made using standard Git practices.
This section describes the basic steps required to contribute using Git
and summarizes some standard practices we use with Keptn.

You can also modify the source using the GitHub editor.
This is very useful when you want to fix a typo
or make some other small change
although be sure so include the DCO signoff.

If you are doing significant work,
you should fork and clone your own copy of the repository,
make your changes in a local branch,
then push those changes to GitHub where they can be reviewed
and ultimately merged into the product.
