# Evaluations

A `KeptnEvaluation` does a simple evaluation of the metrics data you capture,
to answer a question such as "Do I have more than four CPUs available?"
or "Is my remote database accessible?"
or check for other problems in your infrastructure.
It can be defined to run before or after your software is deployed.

When an evaluation is run pre-deployment,
the deployment is kept in a pending state
until the evaluation passes with a successful result.

Evaluations can be defined at:

- `KeptnApp` level, so before or after the deployment of the
  entire ensemble of workloads that makes your application.
- `KeptnWorkload` level, so before or after a single deployment/stateful-set/daemon-set is deployed.

Use the
[Analysis](slo.md)
feature if you want to do more complex investigations
that may include multiple criteria with weights and scoring applied.

To implement evaluations, you must:

1. [Install and enable Keptn](../installation/index.md)
   in your cluster.
   You will need both the
   Keptn Metrics Operator (`metrics-operator`)
   and the Keptn Lifecycle Operator (`lifecycle-operator`)
   [components](../components/index.md).
1. Define a
   [KeptnMetricsProvider](../reference/crd-reference/metricsprovider.md)
   resource for each data source you want to use for evaluations.
   You can define multiple instances of multiple types of data providers.
1. Annotate all
   [workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)
   ([Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/),
   [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/),
   [DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/),
   and
   [ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/))
   with
   [basic annotations](integrate.md#basic-annotations).
1. Generate the required
   [KeptnApp](../reference/crd-reference/app.md)
   resources following the instructions in
   [Auto app discovery](auto-app-discovery.md).
1. Define a
   [KeptnMetric](../reference/crd-reference/metric.md)
   resource for each piece of data
   (defined as a query from one of your data sources)
   that you need for your evaluations.
1. [Create KeptnEvaluationDefinition](#create-keptnevaluationdefinition-resources)
   resources for each evaluation you want to perform.
1. Manually create the appropriate `KeptnAppContext` resource
   listing all `KeptnApp` level evaluations, referring to `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resources
1. Annotate the workload YAML files for each `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource
   you want to run pre- and/or post-deployment.

## Create KeptnEvaluationDefinition resources

A
[KeptnEvaluationDefinition](../reference/crd-reference/evaluationdefinition.md)
resource contains a list of `objectives`,
each of which checks whether a defined `KeptnMetric` resource
meets a defined target value.
The example
[app-pre-deploy-eval.yaml](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/blob/main/examples/sample-app/version-2/app-pre-deploy-eval.yaml)
file specifies the `app-pre-deploy-eval-2` evaluation as follows:

```yaml
{% include "../assets/crd/eval.yaml" %}
```

The `evaluationTarget` is set to be `>1`,
so this evaluation ensures that more than 1 CPU is available
before the [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) or application is deployed.

This evaluation references the
[KeptnMetric](../reference/crd-reference/metric.md) resource
that is named  `available-cpus`.
This is defined in the example
[metric.yaml](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/blob/main/examples/sample-app/base/metric.yaml)
file:

```yaml
{% include "../assets/crd/metric.yaml" %}
```

Note the following:

- One `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource can include
  multiple `objective` fields that reference additional metrics.
  In this example, you might want to also query
  available memory, disk space, and other resources
  that are required for the deployment.
- The `KeptnMetric` resources that are referenced
  in a `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource
  - can be defined on different namespaces in the cluster
  - can query different instances of different types of metric providers
- All objectives within a `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource
  are evaluated in order.
  If the evaluation of any objective fails,
  the `KeptnEvaluation` itself fails.
- You can define multiple evaluations
  for each stage (pre- and post-deployment).
  These evaluations run in parallel so the failure of one evaluation
  has no effect on whether other evaluations are completed.
- The results of each evaluation
  are written to a
  [KeptnEvaluation](../reference/api-reference/lifecycle/v1beta1/index.md#keptnevaluation)
  resource.

## Annotate the workload resource for workload level evaluations

To define the pre-/post-deployment evaluations to run
for a single Kubernetes workload, you need to provide an annotation
for each `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource to be run
pre-/post-deployment.
The annotations for evaluations are:

```yaml
keptn.sh/pre-deployment-evaluations: <evaluation-name>
keptn.sh/post-deployment-evaluations: <evaluation-name>
```

   > **Caveat:** Be very careful when implementing pre-deployment evaluations
     since, if one fails, Keptn prevents the deployment of your workload.
   >

The value of these annotations corresponds
to the values of the `name` field of each
[KeptnTaskDefinition](../reference/crd-reference/taskdefinition.md)
resource.
These resources contain re-usable "functions"
that can execute before and after the deployment.

If everything is fine, the deployment continues.

## Create KeptnAppContext for app level evaluations

To execute pre-/post-deployment evaluations for a `KeptnApp`,
create a `KeptnAppContext` resource with the same name and in the same `namespace` as the `KeptnApp`.
The `KeptnAppContext` resource contains a list of
pre-/post-deployment evaluations
that should be executed before and after the
workloads within the `KeptnApp` are deployed.

See the [Getting started guide](../getting-started/lifecycle-management.md#more-control-over-the-application)
for more information on how to configure a `KeptnAppContext`
to execute pre-/post-deployment checks.

## Example of pre/post-deployment Evaluations

A comprehensive example of pre-/post-deployment
evaluations and tasks can be found in our
[examples folder](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/tree/main/examples/sample-app),
where we use [Podtato-Head](https://github.com/podtato-head/podtato-head)
to run some simple pre-deployment checks both at App and Workload level.
Check out the [readme](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/blob/main/examples/sample-app/README.md)
to learn how to test this example on your machine.
