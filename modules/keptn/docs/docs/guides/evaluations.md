# Evaluations

A `KeptnEvaluation` does a simple evaluation of the metrics data you capture,
to answer a question such as "Do I have more than four CPUs available?"
or "Is my remote database accessible?"
or check for other problems in your infrastructure.
It can be defined to run before or after your software is deployed.

When an evaluation is run pre-deployment,
the deployment is kept in a pending state
until the evaluation passes with a successful result.

Use the
[Analysis](slo.md)
feature if you want to do more complex investigations
that may include multiple criteria with weights and scoring applied.

To implement evaluations, you must:

1. [Install and enable Keptn](../installation/index.md)
   in your cluster.
   You will need both the
   Keptn Metrics Operator (`metrics-operator`)
   and the Keptn Lifecycle Operator (`lifecycle-operator`)
   [components](../components/index.md).
1. Define a
   [KeptnMetricsProvider](../reference/crd-reference/metricsprovider.md)
   resource for each data source you want to use for evaluations.
   You can define multiple instances of multiple types of data providers.
1. Annotate all
   [workloads](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)
   ([Deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/),
   [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/),
   [DaemonSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/),
   and
   [ReplicaSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/))
   with
   [basic annotations](integrate.md#basic-annotations).
1. Generate the required
   [KeptnApp](../reference/crd-reference/app.md)
   resources following the instructions in
   [Auto app discovery](auto-app-discovery.md).
1. Define a
   [KeptnMetric](../reference/crd-reference/metric.md)
   resource for each piece of data
   (defined as a query from one of your data sources)
   that you need for your evaluations.
1. [Create KeptnEvaluationDefinition](#create-keptnevaluationdefinition-resources)
   resources for each evaluation you want to perform.
1. Manually edit the appropriate `KeptnApp` resources
   to annotate them for each `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource
   you want to run pre- and/or post-deployment.

## Create KeptnEvaluationDefinition resources

A
[KeptnEvaluationDefinition](../reference/crd-reference/evaluationdefinition.md)
resource contains a list of `objectives`,
each of which checks whether a defined `KeptnMetric` resource
meets a defined target value.
The example
[app-pre-deploy-eval.yaml](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/blob/main/examples/sample-app/version-2/app-pre-deploy-eval.yaml)
file specifies the `app-pre-deploy-eval-2` evaluation as follows:

```yaml
{% include "../assets/crd/eval.yaml" %}
```

The `evaluationTarget` is set to be `>1`,
so this evaluation ensures that more than 1 CPU is available
before the [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/) or application is deployed.

This evaluation references the
[KeptnMetric](../reference/crd-reference/metric.md) resource
that is named  `available-cpus`.
This is defined in the example
[metric.yaml](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/blob/main/examples/sample-app/base/metric.yaml)
file:

```yaml
{% include "../assets/crd/metric.yaml" %}
```

Note the following:

* One `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource can include
  multiple `objective` fields that reference additional metrics.
  In this example, you might want to also query
  available memory, disk space, and other resources
  that are required for the deployment.
* The `KeptnMetric` resources that are referenced
  in a `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource
  * can be defined on different namespaces in the cluster
  * can query different instances of different types of metric providers
* All objectives within a `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource
  are evaluated in order.
  If the evaluation of any objective fails,
  the `KeptnEvaluation` itself fails.
* You can define multiple evaluations
  for each stage (pre- and post-deployment).
  These evaluations run in parallel so the failure of one evaluation
  has no effect on whether other evaluations are completed.
* The results of each evaluation
  is written to a
  [KeptnEvaluation](../reference/api-reference/lifecycle/v1alpha3/index.md#keptnevaluation)
  resource.

## Annotate the KeptnApp resource

To define the pre/post-deployment evaluations to run,
you must manually edit the
[KeptnApp](../reference/crd-reference/app.md)
YAML file to provide an annotation
for each `KeptnEvaluationDefinition` resource to be run
pre/post-deployment.
The annotations for evaluations are:

```yaml
keptn.sh/pre-deployment-evaluations: <evaluation-name>
keptn.sh/post-deployment-evaluations: <evaluation-name>
```

   > **Caveat:** Be very careful when implementing pre-deployment evaluations
     since, if one fails, Keptn prevents the Deployment from running.
   >

The value of these annotations corresponds
to the values of the `name` field of each
[KeptnTaskDefinition](../reference/crd-reference/taskdefinition.md)
resource.
These resources contain re-usable "functions"
that can execute before and after the deployment.

If everything is fine, the deployment continues.

## Example of pre/post-deployment actions

A comprehensive example of pre/post-deployment
evaluations and tasks can be found in our
[examples folder](https://github.com/keptn/lifecycle-toolkit/tree/main/examples/sample-app),
where we use [Podtato-Head](https://github.com/podtato-head/podtato-head)
to run some simple pre-deployment checks.

To run the example, download the example
then issue the following commands:

```shell
cd ./examples/podtatohead-deployment/
kubectl apply -f .
```

Afterward, use the following command
to monitor the status of the deployment:

```shell
kubectl get keptnworkloadversion -n podtato-kubectl -w
```

The deployment for a workload stays in a `Pending` state
until the respective pre-deployment check is successfully completed.
Afterwards, the deployment starts and when the workload is deployed,
the post-deployment checks start.
