# How to structure your namespaces

You have significant flexibility to decide how many namespaces to use
and how to set them up.
See the Kubernetes
[Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
documentation for some basic information.
You can also search and find many "Best Practices for Namespaces"
documents published on the web.

Some considerations for Keptn:

* Keptn primarily operates on Kubernetes
  [Workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)
  resources and
  [KeptnApp](../../reference/crd-reference/app.md)
  resources
  that are activated and defined by annotations to each workload.
* [KeptnMetricsProvider](../../reference/crd-reference/metricsprovider.md)
  resources need to be located
  in the same namespace as the associated
  [KeptnMetric](../../reference/crd-reference/metric.md)
  resources.
  But
  [KeptnEvaluationDefinition](../../reference/crd-reference/evaluationdefinition.md)
  resources that are used for pre- and post-deployment
  can reference metrics from any namespace.
  So you can create `KeptnMetrics` in a centralized namespace
  (such as `keptn-system`)
  and access those metrics in evaluations on all namespaces in the cluster.
* Analysis related resources
  ([Analysis](../../reference/crd-reference/analysis.md),
  [AnalysisDefinition](../../reference/crd-reference/analysisdefinition.md),
  and
  [AnalysisValueTemplate](../../reference/crd-reference/analysisvaluetemplate.md))
  reference each other via a `name` and, optionally, a `namespace` field.
  The `Analysis` resource references the `AnalysisDefinition` resource,
  which then references the `AnalysisValueTemplate` resources.

  * If the `namespace` in the reference is not set explicitly,
      the `AnalysisDefinition` and `AnalysisValueTemplate` resources
      must reside in the same namespace as the `Analysis` resource.
  * If the `namespace` in the reference is set for the resources,
      the `Analysis`, `AnalysisDefinition`, and `AnalysisValueTemplate` resources
      can each reside in different namespaces.

  This provides configuration options such as the following:

  * You can have one namespace
      with all of your `AnalysisDefinition` and `AnalysisValueTemplate` resources
      and reuse them in the different namespaces where you run analyses.

  * You can have everything strictly namespaced
      and always put the `AnalysisDefinition`, `AnalysisValueTemplate`
      and the `Analysis` resources into the same namespace,
      without adding the explicit namespace selectors
      when creating references between those objects.

* Each `KeptnApp` resource identifies the namespace to which it belongs.
  If you configure multiple namespaces,
  you can have `KeptnApp` resources with the same name
  in multiple namespaces without having them conflict.
* You do not need separate namespaces for separate versions of your application.
  The `KeptnApp` resource includes fields to define
  the `version` as well as a `revision`
  (used if you have to rerun a deployment
  but want to retain the version number).

So, possible namespace designs run the gamut:

* Run all your Keptn work in a single namespace
* Create a separate namespace for each logical grouping of your Keptn work
* Create a separate namespace for each [workload](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/)
