# Migrating to Keptn

Keptn uses a different paradigm than that used for Keptn v1
and so migration from Keptn v1 is not a straight-forward process.
In this section, we will assemble information to help people
who want to move from Keptn v1.

These instructions mostly assume that you want to utilize
all Keptn features.
Note, however, that you can install and use some functionality
such as Keptn Metrics and Observability
without implementing all Keptn features.
