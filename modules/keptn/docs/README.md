# Choosing where to add documentation

If the change to the docs needs to reflect the next version of Keptn, please edit them here, following the instructions
below.
For already existing documentation versions directly edit them
from <https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/lifecycle-toolkit-docs> or from <https://lifecycle.keptn.sh/>.

## Adding documentation to the dev repo

To verify your changes to the dev documentations you can use the makefile:

```shell
make build
make server
```

> **Note**
If the above command is not working try with `sudo` command.

After the server is running on <http://localhost:1314>.
Any modification in the docs folder will be reflected on the server under the dev revision.
You can modify the content in realtime to verify the correct behaviour of links and such.

### Markdown linting

To check your markdown files for linter errors, run the following from the repo root:

```shell
make markdownlint
```

To use the auto-fix option, run:

```shell
make markdownlint-fix
```

## Publishing

We are using Netlify to publish our pages.
There are 3 different types of publication:

1. pull request previews
2. development documentation aka staging (build of `main` branch) - [link](https://main.lifecycle.keptn.sh)
3. official documentation aka production (build of `page` branch) - [link](https://lifecycle.keptn.sh)

Within the navigation bar, we do have version links pointing to the different publications - if it makes sense.
For example, we are not linking from development and production to pull request previews.

### Pull request preview

- build: on each pull request with documentation changes
- build-environment: development
- config folder: [_default](./config/_default/)

The pull request preview will be generated if documentation files have been touched - this is configured in the [netlify.toml](../netlify.toml).

This preview should help contributors to inspect their changes within our usual page release.
Furthermore, it allows reviewers to inspect the rendered documentation without building it on their own.

### Development page

- build: on each push to `main` with documentation changes
- build-environment: main
- config folder: [main](./config/staging/)

This page reflects the current development status of the documentation.
It will be built regularly and can be easily accessed.

It should allow bleeding-edge users and contributors to see the current state and help with debugging etc.

### Official documentation

- build: on each push to `page` with documentation changes
- build-environment: production
- config folder: [production](./config/production/)

This documentation set contains all released versions of Keptn and is stored in an orphaned branch called `page`.

Each version has its own `docs` folder named `docs-<version>`.
Except for the latest version which will be within the `docs` folder.

Each version-specific documentation contains a `version` file containing the version string.
This is important so we do know which version it contains - specifically important for `docs` of the latest version.

`Docsy` offers a mechanism to build a version menu based on Hugo's configuration.
We extended this mechanism and enhanced it with a check for directories starting with `docs` and containing a `version` file.
For more details inspect [our theme with a layout file with adaptations](https://github.com/keptn/docs-tooling).
This way we do not need to adapt the configuration all the time we are releasing a new version.
