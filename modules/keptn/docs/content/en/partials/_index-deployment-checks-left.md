## Orchestrate Deployment Checks

To reduce complexity of custom checks use Keptn to:

* Pre-Deploy:
  * Validate external dependencies
  * Confirm images are scanned
  * ...
* Post-Deploy:
  * Execute tests
  * Notify Stakeholders
  * Promote to next stage
  * ...
* Automatically validate against your SLOs (Service Level Objectives)
