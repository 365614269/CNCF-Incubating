Before using the **Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit**
as a contributor to the Kepth Lifecycle Toolkit repository,
it is expected that you comply with the guidelines while
making contributions towards the repository.

## Guidelines for contributing

* Always fork the repository then clone that fork to your local system
  rather than clone `main` directly.
  Keptn, like most open source projects,
  severely restricts who can push changes directly to the `main` branch
  to protect the integrity of the repository.
* Keep your language clean and crisp.
* Smaller PR's are easier to review and so generally get processed more quickly;
  when possible, chunk your work into smallish PR's.
  However, we recognize that documentation work sometimes requires larger PRs,
  such as when writing a whole new section or reorganizing existing files.
* You may want to squash your commits before creating the final PR,
  to avoid conflicting commits.
  This is **not mandatory**; the maintainers will squash your commits
  during the merge when necessary.
* Be sure that the description of the pull request itself
  is meaningful and clear.
  This helps reviewers understand each commit
  and provides a good history after the PR is merged.
* If your PR is not reviewed in a timely fashion,
  feel free to post a gentle reminder to the `#keptn-docs` Slack channel.
* Resolve review comments and suggestions promptly.

If you see a problem and are unable to fix it yourself
or have an idea for an enhancement,
please create an issue on the GitHub repository.

* Provide specific and detailed information about the problem
  and possible solutions to help others understand the issue.
* When reporting a bug, provide a detailed list of steps to reproduce the bug.
  If possible, also attach screenshots that illustrate the bug.
* If you want to do the work on an issue,
  include that information in your description of the issue
  or in a comment to the issue.
