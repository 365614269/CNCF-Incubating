The SLIs and SLOs used for Keptn v1 quality gates can be ported to
Keptn KeptnMetrics and KeptnEvaluationDefintions.

By default, Keptn includes additional observability features
that are not included in Keptn v1:

* [DORA metrics](../../implementing/dora)
* [OpenTelemetry observability](../../implementing/otel.md)

Keptn v1 Quality Gates can be migrated into Keptn metrics
and Keptn evaluations.

> **Note**
The full SLO capabilities
provided by Keptn v1 such as weighting and scoring
have a first implementation in the [Analysis](../../implementing/slo/).

Notice the paradigm differences when implementing Keptn evaluations:

* Data providers are installed and configured into your Kubernetes cluster
  using Helm charts and standard practices.
* You must populate a
  [KeptnMetricsProvider](../../yaml-crd-ref/metricsprovider.md) resource
  for each instance of each data provider.
  This resource specifies the URL and namespace for the data provider
  and gives it a unique `name` that can be referenced by other resources.
  This is the only Keptn specific configuration that is required.
* Each query that is specified in your Keptn v1
  [slo.yaml](https://keptn.sh/docs/1.0.x/reference/files/sli/) file
  should be converted into its own
  [KeptnMetric](../../yaml-crd-ref/metric.md) resource
  if you are using it for an evaluation.
  Note that Keptn supports using multiple instances of multiple data providers.
* Simple Keptn v1 comparisons that are defined in
  [slo.yaml](https://keptn.sh/docs/1.0.x/reference/files/slo/)
  files can be converted to
  [KeptnEvaluationDefinition](../../yaml-crd-ref/evaluationdefinition.md)
  resources.
* Keptn v1 calculations that use weighting and scoring
  cannot currently be implemented for Keptn
  but this functionality is under development.

[Keptn Metrics](../../implementing/evaluatemetrics.md)
page.
