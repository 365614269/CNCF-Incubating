This section provides exercises to introduce you to
the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit.
Choose the exercise that interests you the most.

## Introducing the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit

This exercise introduces three common use cases for the Lifecycle Toolkit
and walks you through the implementation process for each.
We recommend that you do all three exercises in order
but you can do any of them independently.

* [Getting started with Keptn metrics](metrics)
* [Standardize access to observability data](observability)
* [Manage the release cycle](orchestrate)

These exercises are based on the
[simplenode-dev](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/klt-on-k3s-with-argocd)
example.
You can clone that repo to access it locally
or just look at it for examples
as you implement the functionality "from scratch"
on your local Kubernetes cluster.
The
[README](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox/klt-on-k3s-with-argocd/blob/main/setup/observability/README.md)
file for that repo contains additional information.

You can run these exercises on an existing Kubernetes cluster
or you can create a new cluster.
For personal study and demonstrations,
these exercises run well on a local Kubernetes cluster.
See [Create Local Kubernetes Cluster](../install/k8s.md/#create-local-kubernetes-cluster).

Two videos are available to introduce these exercises:

* [Introducing Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit](https://youtu.be/449HAFYkUlY)
* [Use SLOs and get DORA the Native K8s way!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeEC0475SOU)

## Getting started with Lifecycle Toolkit

The
[KLT End-to-end exercise](generic-gs)
exercise provides a more detailed exercise
for managing the deployment lifecycle
with pre- and post-deployment evaluations and tasks.
