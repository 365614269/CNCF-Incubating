This section provides comprehensive reference information about the
manifest files that must be populated
for the Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit
[Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

Each CRD is an object of an API library.
In addition to the CRDs documented in this section,
Keptn populates many resources on its own.
For a comprehensive list of all Keptn resources, see
[API Reference](../crd-ref).

For more information about CRDs and APIs, see the Kubernetes documentation:

* [API Overview](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/)

* [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)

* [API versioning](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning)
