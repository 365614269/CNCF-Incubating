## KLT Pre and Post Deployment Tasks

When KLT is successfully monitoring your deployments, it can also run arbitrary tasks and SLO evaluations:

- pre-deployment (before the pod is scheduled) and
- post-deployment (after the post is scheduled)

Go to the [pre and post deployment checks page](../implementing/integrate#pre--and-post-deployment-checks) to find out more.
