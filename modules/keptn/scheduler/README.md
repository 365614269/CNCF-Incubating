# Scheduler

The **scheduler** is a pivotal component within
[Keptn](https://lifecycle.keptn.sh/) that plays a crucial role in orchestrating the deployment process.
By ensuring that Pods are scheduled onto nodes only after successful pre-deployment checks,
the scheduler minimizes errors and downtimes.

For detailed information about scheduler's functionality and how it works, please refer to
the [Keptn Scheduler Architecture](https://lifecycle.keptn.sh/docs/concepts/architecture/components/scheduler/) section.
