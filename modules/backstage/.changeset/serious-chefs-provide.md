Avoid Layout Shift for `DismissableBanner` when using a `storageApi` with latency (e.g. `user-settings-backend`)

Properly handle the `unknown` state of the `storageApi`. There's a trade-off: this may lead to some Layout Shift if the banner has not been dismissed, but once it has been dismissed, you won't have any.
