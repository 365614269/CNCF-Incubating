**DEPRECATION**: Deprecated `ScaffolderEntitiesProcessor`, which should now instead be imported from `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend-module-scaffolder-entity-model`.

`catalogModuleTemplateKind` was also moved to that package and renamed to `catalogModuleScaffolderEntityModel`, without any deprecation since it was an alpha export.
