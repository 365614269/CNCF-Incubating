'@backstage/backend-common': patch
---

We are deprecating the legacy `createServiceBuilder` factory, so if you are still using it, please checkout the migration guide and [migrate](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/migrating) your plugin to use the new backend system.
