## Status

The new backend system is in alpha, but many plugins have already been migrated. We recommend all plugins to migrate to the new system, and you can also try it out in your own production deployments.

You can find an example backend setup in [the `backend-next` package](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/tree/master/packages/backend-next).
