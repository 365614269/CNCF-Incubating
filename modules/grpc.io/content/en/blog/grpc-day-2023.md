The gRPC core engineering team is excited to share a new video playlist that accelerates your getting started with gRPC and helps you better understand recently introduced innovations such as gRPC Microservices Observability in GCP (for the full announcement, see [blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/introducing-grpc-observability-for-microservices) and [codelab](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/grpc).

The materials are for any audience, including individuals starting their gRPC journey as well as established gRPC coders, and place the core technologies of gRPC at your fingertips.

The video series includes the following clips:
