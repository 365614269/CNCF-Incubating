While it is not mandatory to do so, gRPC applications often leverage [Protocol
Buffers][pb] for service definitions and data serialization.

The protocol buffer compiler, `protoc`, is used to compile `.proto` files, which
contain service and message definitions. For instructions on installing `protoc`,
see the [Protobuf.dev web site](https://protobuf.dev/installation/).
