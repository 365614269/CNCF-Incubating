<!--more-->

This guide is most relevant to platform operators.

See the [spec release](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/releases/tag/platform%2Fv0.10) for platform API 0.10 for the full list of changes and further details.

## Platform Operator

### The `launcher` supports overridable process arguments

The way user-provided arguments are handled by the launcher depends on the buildpack API of the buildpack that created the process definition.

#### Newer buildpacks

Process types contributed by newer buildpacks (buildpack API 0.9 and above) may have overridable process arguments. Looking at metadata.toml:
```
[[processes]]
type = "from-newer-buildpack"
command = ["some-command", "always-1", "always-2"]
args = ["override-1", "override-2"]
```

`always-1` and `always-2` are arguments that are always provided to `some-command`. If no user-provided arguments are specified when the application image is launched, `override-1` and `override-2` will also be provided. If user-provided arguments are specified, these will be provided **instead of** `override-1` and `override-2`. Example:

```
docker run --entrypoint from-newer-buildpack my-image
```

will result in the following command invocation: `some-command always-1 always-2 override-1 override-2`. However:

```
docker run --entrypoint from-newer-buildpack my-image user-1 user-2
```

will result in the following command invocation: `some-command always-1 always-2 user-1 user-2`.

#### Older buildpacks

Process types contributed by older buildpacks (buildpack API 0.8 and below) do not have overridable process arguments. Looking at metadata.toml:
```
[[processes]]
type = "from-older-buildpack"
command = ["some-command"]
args = ["always-1", "always-2"]
```

The `command` list will never have more than one element. `always-1` and `always-2` are arguments that are always provided to `some-command`. If no user-provided arguments are specified when the application image is launched, `always-1` and `always-2` will be provided only. If user-provided arguments are specified, these will be **appended** to the `args` list. Example:

```
docker run --entrypoint from-newer-buildpack my-image
```

will result in the following command invocation: `some-command always-1 always-2`. However:

```
docker run --entrypoint from-older-buildpack my-image user-1 user-2
```

will result in the following command invocation: `some-command always-1 always-2 user-1 user-2`.

### Image extensions are supported (experimental)

Platform 0.10 introduces image extensions as experimental components for customizing build and run-time base images (see [here](/docs/features/dockerfiles) for more information). Image extensions output Dockerfiles which are applied by the lifecycle using [kaniko][https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/kaniko], a tool for building container images in Kubernetes, as a library.

Note: image extensions are not supported for Windows container images.

* To create a builder with extensions, ensure the `pack` version in use is at least `0.28.0` and enable experimental features: `pack config experimental`.
* Enable experimental features in the lifecycle by setting `CNB_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=warn` or `CNB_EXPERIMENTAL_MODE=silent` in the lifecycle execution environment for ALL lifecycle phases
* Invoke `analyzer` as usual
* Invoke `detector` with a new optional argument: `-generated`, to specify the directory where Dockerfiles generated by image extensions will be output (defaults to `<layers>/generated`) and include image extensions in `order.toml`
  * Dockerfiles for customizing the build image can be found in `<generated>/build/<image extension ID>/Dockerfile`
  * Dockerfiles for customizing the run image can be found in `<generated>/run/<image extension ID>/Dockerfile`
    * The new run image will be written to `analyzed.toml`
* Invoke `restorer` with a new required argument (when using extensions): `-build-image`, a tag reference to the builder image in use
  * A new volume mount is introduced with target `/kaniko`; this volume must be writable by the `restorer` user
* Invoke `extender` (new lifecycle binary), instead of `builder`; the extender will use kaniko to apply the relevant generated Dockerfiles to the build image and then drop privileges to run the `build` phase
  * The same volume from `restore` should be mounted at `/kaniko`
  * The `extender` user should have sufficient permissions to execute all `RUN` instructions in each Dockerfile - typically, it should run as `root`
  * Consult the [platform specification](https://github.com/buildpacks/spec/blob/main/platform.md) for the full list of configuration options for the `extender`
* Invoke `exporter` as usual
  * If Dockerfiles for customizing the run image were output by extensions, the `exporter` will use the run image designated by the extension process

Extensions workflows are not currently supported when using the `creator` binary, though support may be added in the future.
