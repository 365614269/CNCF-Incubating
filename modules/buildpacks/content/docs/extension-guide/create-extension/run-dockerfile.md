### Examine `curl` extension

#### detect

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
cat $PWD/samples/extensions/curl/bin/detect
```

The extension always detects (because its exit code is `0`) and provides a dependency called `curl`.

#### generate

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
cat $PWD/samples/extensions/curl/bin/generate
```

The extension generates a `run.Dockerfile` that switches the run image to reference `run-image-curl`.

### Build a run image for `curl` extension to use

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
cat $PWD/samples/stacks/alpine/run/curl.Dockerfile
```

This is a simple Dockerfile that creates a CNB run image from the `curl` base image by adding the required CNB user configuration and `io.buildpacks.stack.id` label.

The Dockerfile could come from anywhere, but we include it in the `stacks` directory for convenience.

Build the run image:

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
docker build \
  --file $PWD/samples/stacks/alpine/run/curl.Dockerfile \
  --tag localhost:5000/run-image-curl .
```

### Re-build the application image

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
pack build hello-extensions \
  --builder localhost:5000/extensions-builder \
  --env BP_EXT_DEMO=1 \
  --env BP_REQUIRES=vim,curl \
  --path $PWD/samples/apps/java-maven \
  --pull-policy always \
  --network host \
  --verbose
```

Note that `--network host` is necessary when publishing to a local registry.

You should see:

```

### See the image run successfully

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
docker run --rm hello-extensions
```

You should see something akin to:

```
curl 7.85.0-DEV (x86_64-pc-linux-musl) ... more stuff here ...
```

What happened: now that `hello-extensions` requires both `vim` and `curl` in its build plan, both extensions are
  included in the build and provide the needed dependencies for build and launch, respectively
* The `vim` extension installs `vim` at build time, as before
* The `curl` extension switches the run image to `run-image-curl`, which has `curl` installed

Now our `curl` process can succeed!

## What's next?

The `vim` and `curl` examples are very simple, but we can unlock powerful new features with this functionality.

Platforms could have several run images available, each tailored to a specific language family, thus limiting the number
of installed dependencies for each image to the minimum necessary to support the targeted language. Image extensions
could be used to switch the run image to that most appropriate for the current application.

Similarly, builder images could be kept lean if image extensions are used to dynamically install the needed dependencies
for each application.

In the future, both run image switching and run image modification will be supported, opening the door to other use
cases. Consult the [RFC](https://github.com/buildpacks/rfcs/pull/173) for further information.
