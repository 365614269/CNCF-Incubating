Builder images can be kept lean if image extensions are used to dynamically install the needed dependencies
for the current application.

### Examine `vim` extension

#### detect

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
cat $PWD/samples/extensions/vim/bin/detect
```

The extension always detects (because its exit code is `0`) and provides a dependency called `vim` by writing to the build plan.

#### generate

<!-- test:exec -->
```bash
cat $PWD/samples/extensions/vim/bin/generate
```

The extension generates a `build.Dockerfile` that installs `vim` on the builder image.

### Configure the `hello-extensions` buildpack to require `vim`

Set the `BP_REQUIRES` build-time environment variable to configure the `hello-extensions` buildpack to require `vim` (review the `./bin/detect` script to see why this works).

<!-- test:exec -->
```
pack build hello-extensions \
  --builder localhost:5000/extensions-builder \
  --env BP_EXT_DEMO=1 \
  --env BP_REQUIRES=vim \
  --network host \
  --path $PWD/samples/apps/java-maven \
  --pull-policy always \
  --verbose
```

Note that `--network host` is necessary when publishing to a local registry.

You should see:

### See the image fail to run

```
docker run --rm hello-extensions
```

You should see:

```
ERROR: failed to launch: path lookup: exec: "curl": executable file not found in $PATH
```

What happened: our builder uses run image `cnbs/sample-base-run:alpine`, which does not have `curl` installed, so our
  process failed to launch.

Let's take a look at how the `samples/curl` extension fixes the error by switching the run image to another image...
