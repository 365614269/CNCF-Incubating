Volcano is CNCF's first cloud native batch computing project, focusing on high performance computing scenarios such as AI, big data, and genomics analysis. Its core capabilities include:

• Unified Scheduling: Supports integrated job scheduling for both Kubernetes native workloads and mainstream computing frameworks (such as TensorFlow, Spark, PyTorch, Ray, Flink, etc.).

• Queue Management: Provides multi-level queue management capabilities, enabling fine-grained resource quota control and task priority scheduling.

• Heterogeneous Device Support: Efficiently schedules heterogeneous devices like GPU and NPU, fully unleashing hardware computing potential.

• Network Topology Aware Scheduling: Greatly enhancing model training efficiency in AI distributed training scenarios.

• Multi-cluster Scheduling: Supports cross cluster job scheduling, improving resource pool management capabilities and achieving large scale load balancing.

• Online and Offline Workloads Colocation: Enables online and offline workloads colocation, improving cluster resource utilization through intelligent scheduling strategies.

•  Load Aware Descheduling: Optimizing cluster load distribution and enhancing system stability.

As the industry's first cloud native batch computing engine, Volcano has been widely applied in high-performance computing scenarios such as artificial intelligence, big data, and genome sequencing, providing powerful support for enterprises to build elastic, efficient, and intelligent computing platforms.
