### TensorFlow introduction

TensorFlow is a symbolic mathematical system based on data flow programming, which is widely used in programming and realization of various machine learning algorithms. Its predecessor is DistBelief, a neural network algorithm library of Google.

### TensorFlow on Volcano

PS-worker model: Parameter Server performs model-related services, Work Server trains related services, inference calculation, gradient calculation, etc[1].

{{<figure library="1" src="ps-worker.png" title="ps-worker">}}

TensorFlow on Kubernetes has many problems:

- Resource isolation.
- Lack of GPU scheduling, Gang Schuler.
- Process Legacy.
- Training log is not convenient to save.

Create `tftest.yaml`.

Deploy `tftest.yaml`.

```
kubectl apply -f tftest.yaml
```

View job health.

```
kubectl get pod
```
