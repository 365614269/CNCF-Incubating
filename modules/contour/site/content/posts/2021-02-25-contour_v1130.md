Contour continues to add new features to help you better manage ingress operations in a cluster.
Our latest release, Contour 1.13.0, adds several new features. This post will focus on two of the
features, support for [Gateway API][1] and [global rate limiting][2].

## Gateway API

__FEATURE STATE:__ Contour v1.13.0 [alpha][3]

Contour now provides alpha support for [Gateway API][1], an open source project to evolve service
networking APIs within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Gateway API consists of multiple resources that provide
user interfaces to expose Kubernetes applications- Services, Ingress, and more.

Support for Gateway API is implemented across Contour and [Contour Operator][5]. This approach aligns
with the [personas][15] defined by Gateway API. The operator manages infrastructure-level resources, i.e.
[Gateway][6], while Contour manages application-level resources such as [HTTPRoute][7].

Refer to the [user guide][4] for additional details and to start using Gateway API with Contour.

A big thanks to [@stevesloka](https://github.com/stevesloka) and [@youngnick](https://github.com/youngnick),
for designing and implementing this feature!

## Global Rate Limiting

Contour now supports [global rate limiting][8], where Envoy communicates with an external Rate Limit Service
(RLS) over gRPC to make rate limit decisions for requests. Envoy is configured to produce 1+ descriptors for
incoming requests, containing things like the client IP, header values, etc. Envoy sends these descriptors
to the RLS, and the service returns a rate limiting decision to Envoy based on the descriptors and RLS
configured rate limits.

To use global rate limiting with Contour, you'll need to:
- Choose and deploy an RLS. There is an [Envoy rate limit service][9] implementation, but any service that
  implements the [RateLimitService gRPC interface][10] is supported.
- Configure Contour for the RLS.
- Add a global rate limit policy to your `HTTPProxy`.
- Define rate limits in your RLS config.

Refer to the [Contour global rate limiting guide][11] for using the feature with Envoy RLS as an example.

For more information, see:
- [Contour rate limiting documentation][12]
- [HTTPProxy API reference][13]
- [Envoy HTTP global rate limit filter documentation][14]
