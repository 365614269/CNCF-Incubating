<!--  Thanks for asking for a decision! Here are some tips for you:

1. Decisions should be large ones, that cut across many parts of a repo
   or the project as a whole. "Should we change Contour's support policy"
   is an example of a decision that's relevant here, "Should we implement
   this feature" is an example of a decision that's not.
   If in doubt, ask in #contour on the Kubernetes Slack.
2. Contour's maintainers have the binding votes, but non-binding votes are welcomed.
