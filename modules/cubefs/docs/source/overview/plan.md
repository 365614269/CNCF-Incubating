## Versioning support by CubeFS
This document describes the versions supported by the CubeFS project.

Service versioning and supported versions
CubeFS versions are expressed as x.y.z, where x is the major version, y is the minor version, and z is the patch version, following Semantic Versioning terminology. New minor versions may add additional features to the API.

The CubeFS project maintains release branches for the current version and previous release. For example, when v3.3.* is the current version, v3.1.* is supported. When v3.4.* is released, v3.1.* goes out of support.

The project Maintainers own this decision.
