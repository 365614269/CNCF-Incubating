**SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. – October 15, 2024** – The Cloud Native Computing Foundation® (CNCF®), which builds sustainable ecosystems for cloud native software, announced the graduation of KubeEdge.

We would like to thank our TOC sponsors **Cathy Zhang and Lin Sun**, and everyone who has collaborated over the past six years
on KubeEdge’s design, development, and deployment.

KubeEdge is an open source edge computing project built on Kubernetes, which expands the cloud native ecosystem to scenarios and industries
outside of data centers. It extends Kubernetes’ native container orchestration and scheduling capabilities to the edge and provides capabilities
such as edge application management, cloud-edge metadata synchronization, and edge IoT device management.

KubeEdge was open sourced by Huawei Cloud in November 2018. It was accepted as the first cloud native edge project in the CNCF Sandbox project in 2019
and was promoted to an incubating project in September 2020.

Since joining CNCF, the project team has grown to include maintainers from 15 organizations and has attracted over 1,600 contributors from more than 35 countries and
110 organizations. Contributing organizations include Huawei Cloud, DaoCloud, HarmonyCloud, China Unicom, Inovex, ARM, QingCloud Technology, BoCloud, China Mobile, Inspur,
Sony, China Telecom, Zhejiang Lab, SEL Laboratory of Zhejiang University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

“KubeEdge started with a vision to extend cloud native technology to the edge and foster a robust edge-cloud computing ecosystem. Today, it has been adopted across numerous
innovative and unforeseen fields. This achievement is a testament to the incredible creativity and dedication of our contributors, whose efforts have driven the project’s success,” said Kevin Wang and Yin Ding, KubeEdge TSC members.
“Graduation marks a new beginning, and we are excited to explore even greater possibilities for the entire cloud native ecosystem.”

KubeEdge has been widely applied in various industries, including CDN, intelligent transportation, smart energy, smart retail, smart parks, automobiles, intelligent logistics, finance, power, and blockchain.
It has been deployed in industry-leading projects such as the largest cloud native cloud-edge collaborative highway toll station management project, the first cloud native satellite-ground collaborative satellite,
the first cloud native electric vehicle, and more.

“Kubernetes was born through usage across massive data centers but has evolved, just like Linux, for new environments and has become a leading platform in edge computing,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO, CNCF.
“KubeEdge has been at the forefront of this transformation, bringing Kubernetes into new frontiers from electric cars to outer space. We look forward to seeing where the KubeEdge project goes next as a graduate project.”
