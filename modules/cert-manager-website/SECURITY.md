# Vulnerability Reporting Process

Security is the number one priority for cert-manager. If you think you've
found a vulnerability in the cert-manager website, or in any cert-manager
project, please follow the [vulnerability reporting process](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
documented in the main cert-manager repository.
