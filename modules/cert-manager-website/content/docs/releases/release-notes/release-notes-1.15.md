> `crds.keep=false` when installing the Helm chart.

cert-manager 1.15 promotes several features to beta, including GatewayAPI support (`ExperimentalGatewayAPISupport`), the ability to provide a subject in the Certificate that will be used literally in the CertificateSigningRequest (`LiteralCertificateSubject`) and the outputting of additional certificate formats (`AdditionalCertificateOutputFormats`).

## `v1.15.4`

This patch release makes [several changes](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7402) to how PEM input is validated in
cert-manager, adding maximum sizes appropriate to the type of PEM data which is being parsed.

This is to prevent an unacceptable slow-down in parsing specially crafted PEM data. The issue was found by Google's OSS-Fuzz project.

The issue is low severity; to exploit the PEM issue would require privileged access which would likely allow Denial-of-Service through other methods.

Note also that since most PEM data parsed by cert-manager comes from `ConfigMap` or `Secret` resources which have
a max size limit of approximately 1MB, it's difficult to force cert-manager to parse large amounts of PEM data.

Further details are in the [security advisory](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/security/advisories/GHSA-r4pg-vg54-wxx4).

In addition, the version of Go used to build cert-manager 1.15 was updated along with the base images, and a Route53 bug fix was backported.

### Bug Fixes

- Prevent aggressive Route53 retries caused by STS authentication failures by removing the Amazon Request ID from STS errors. ([#7261](https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/7261), [@cert-manager-bot](https://github.com/cert-manager-bot))
