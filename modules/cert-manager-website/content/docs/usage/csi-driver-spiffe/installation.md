## Installation Steps

### 1. Install cert-manager

csi-driver-spiffe requires cert-manager to be [installed](../../installation/README.md) but
a default installation of cert-manager **will not work**.

> ⚠️ It is **vital** that the [default approver is disabled in cert-manager](../../usage/certificaterequest.md#approver-controller) ⚠️

If the default approver is not disabled, the csi-driver-spiffe approver will
race with cert-manager and policy enforcement will become useless.

```bash
helm repo add jetstack https://charts.jetstack.io --force-update

# NOTE: This isn't the usual cert-manager install process;
# we're disabling the cert-manager approver.
# See explanation above!

helm upgrade -i -n cert-manager cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \
  --set extraArgs={--controllers='*\,-certificaterequests-approver'} \
  --set installCRDs=true \
  --create-namespace
```

### 2. Configure an Issuer / ClusterIssuer

Install or configure a [ClusterIssuer](../../configuration/README.md) to give
cert-manager the ability to sign against your Trust Domain.

If you want a namespace-scoped Issuer, then it must be created in every namespace
that Pods will mount volumes from.

You must use an Issuer type which is compatible with signing URI SAN certificates;
ACME issuers won't generally work, and the SelfSigned issuer is not appropriate.

An example demo [ClusterIssuer](../../concepts/issuer.md#namespaces) can
be found [in the csi-driver-spiffe repo](https://github.com/cert-manager/csi-driver-spiffe/blob/ed646ccf28b1ecdf63f628bf16f1d350a9b850c1/deploy/example/clusterissuer.yaml).

> ⚠️ This Trust Domain's root CA is generated by cert-manager and **the private key is stored in the cluster**
> This might not be appropriate for production deployments!

We'll also use [cmctl](../../reference/cmctl.md) to approve the CertificateRequest,
since the default approver was disabled above.

```terminal
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/csi-driver-spiffe/ed646ccf28b1ecdf63f628bf16f1d350a9b850c1/deploy/example/clusterissuer.yaml

# We must also approve the CertificateRequest since we
# disabled the default approver
cmctl approve -n cert-manager \
  $(kubectl get cr -n cert-manager -ojsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
```

### 3. Install csi-driver-spiffe

Install csi-driver-spiffe into the cluster using the issuer we configured. We
must also configure the issuer resource type and name of the issuer we
configured so that the approver has [permissions to approve referencing CertificateRequests](../../usage/certificaterequest.md#rbac-syntax).

Note that the `issuer.name`, `issuer.kind` and `issuer.group` will need to be changed to match
the issuer you're actually using!

```bash
helm upgrade -i -n cert-manager cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe jetstack/cert-manager-csi-driver-spiffe --wait \
 --set "app.logLevel=1" \
 --set "app.trustDomain=my.trust.domain" \
 --set "app.approver.signerName=clusterissuers.cert-manager.io/csi-driver-spiffe-ca" \
 \
 --set "app.issuer.name=csi-driver-spiffe-ca" \
 --set "app.issuer.kind=ClusterIssuer" \
 --set "app.issuer.group=cert-manager.io"
```
