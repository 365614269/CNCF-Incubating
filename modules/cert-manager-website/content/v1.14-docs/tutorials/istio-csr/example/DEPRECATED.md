The files in this folder are deprecated and will be removed in the future.
Please use the files linked in the new istio-csr installation documentation.

We have to keep these files for now because they are linked from the old installation documentation.
The following links were part of the old installation documentation:

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/istio-csr/example/example-issuer.yaml

curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cert-manager/website/master/content/docs/tutorials/istio-csr/example/istio-config-getting-started.yaml > istio-install-config.yaml
```
